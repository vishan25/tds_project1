Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\n[](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)\nWhat Makes an Agent?\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n1. LLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next\n2. Tools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\n3. Memory: Retains context across multiple steps"}
{"text": "3. Memory: Retains context across multiple steps\nAgents operate through a loop:\n Observe the environment\n Think about what to do\n Take action using tools\n Observe results\n Repeat until task completion\nCommand-Line Agent Example\nWe’ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that:\n1. Takes a task description from the command line\n2. Generates code to accomplish the task\n3. Automatically extracts and executes the code\n4. Passes the results back to the LLM\n5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\nHere’s how it works:\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\nThe agent will:"}
{"text": "The agent will:\n1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes\n2. Execute the script in a subprocess\n3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)\n4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\n5. Present a final answer to the user\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script\n2. Code extraction from the LLM response\n3. Code execution in a subprocess\n4. Result interpretation by the LLM\n5. Error handling and retry logic if needed\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\n Planning (generating code)\n Execution (running the code)\n Reflection (interpreting results)\n Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)\nAgent Architectures\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:"}

Plan-and-Execute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\nReal-World Applications\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\n1. Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information\n2. Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code\n3. Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data\n4.

Hallucination: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\n2. Planning limitations: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\n3.

{"text": "Parsing_JSON.md\nParsing JSON\n----------------------------------------------\nJSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\nFor example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\n[](https://youtu.be/1lxrbezP-g)\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\n| Tool | Extract from JSON… | Why |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| jq | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |"}
{"text": "| --- | --- | --- |\n| jq | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |\n| JMESPath | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax |\n| ijson | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently |\n| Pandas | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data |\n| SQL JSON | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data |\n| DuckDB | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |\nExamples:\n Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\n Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\n Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\nPractice with these resources:"}
{"text": "Practice with these resources:\n JSONPath Online Evaluator: Test JSON queries\n jq play: Interactive jq query testing\n DuckDB JSON Tutorial: Learn DuckDB JSON functions\nCommand-line JSON Processing with jq\njq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\nExample: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\nExtract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\nTransform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\nFilter and aggregate"}

It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\nExample: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\nimport jmespath\nExample queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},"}
{"text": "\"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\nFind all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > 700000].name\", data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\nStreaming with ijson\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\nExample: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\nimport ijson\nasync def processlargejson(filepath: str) -> list:"}
{"text": "import ijson\nasync def processlargejson(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n    return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\nPandas JSON Columns\nPandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations."}
{"text": "Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\nimport pandas as pd\nParse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'jsoncol': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['jsoncol'].apply(pd.jsonnormalize)\nNormalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.readcsv('data.csv')\ndfnormalized = pd.jsonnormalize(\n    df['nestedjson'].apply(json.loads),\n    recordpath=['items'],        List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      Keep these columns from parent\n)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\nSQL JSON Functions\nSQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases."}
{"text": "These are implemented by most popular databases, including\nSQLite,\nPostgreSQL, and\nMySQL.\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\nExample: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\nSELECT\n    jsonextract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    jsonextract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE jsonextract(data, '$.active') = trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\nDuckDB JSON Processing"}

So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n1. Search.
