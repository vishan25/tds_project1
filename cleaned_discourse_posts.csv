I don’t know about solution to this.
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
All the image ids we evaluated were what you submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us.
For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.
How to fix bugs in our scripts

If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?

There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.
Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.
I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.

The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing.

replacing missing values with the mean age b deleting rows with missing age values c replacing missing values with a fixed age such as d leaving the missing values as they are without any action answer d leaving missing values unaddressed can lead to errors in analysis and modeling options a b and c are common strategies for handling missing data depending on the context and the extent of the missingness module data analysis q statistical measures which of the following statistical measures is not sensitive to extreme values outliers in a dataset a mean b median c standard deviation d range answer b the median represents the middle value of a dataset and is not affected by outliers in contrast the mean standard deviation and range can be significantly influenced by extreme values module large language models q tokenization in nlp in natural language processing what is the primary purpose of tokenization a to translate text from one language to another b to split text into individual words or subwords c to encrypt text for secure communication d to summarize large texts into shorter versions answer b tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller components such as words or subwords which can then be processed by language models this is a fundamental step in nlp tasks module geospatial and network analysis q geographic coordinate systems which of the following coordinate systems is commonly used to represent locations on earths surface a cartesian coordinate system b polar coordinate system c geographic coordinate system latitude and longitude d cylindrical coordinate system answer c the geographic coordinate system uses latitude and longitude to specify locations on earths surface this system is widely used in geospatial analysis module data visualization q effective data visualization when creating a bar chart to compare the sales performance of different products which practice should be avoided a ordering bars from highest to lowest value b using different colors for each bar without a legend c starting the yaxis at zero d labeling each bar with its exact value answer b using different colors for each bar without a legend can confuse the audience as they may assume the colors represent different categories consistency and clarity are key in effective data visualization module everyday tools q vs code feature use you are editing a python script in visual studio code and want to quickly find and edit all occurrences of a variable name in the current file what feature should you use a git integration b debug panel c multicursor editing d terminal commands answer c multicursor editing allows you to place multiple cursors in a file and edit text in multiple locations at once it is useful for refactoring variable names or repeated patterns module data sourcing q data api identification which of the following data sources is most likely to provide structured data accessible via an api a a scanned pdf document b a screenshot of a chart c the world bank data portal d a newspaper article answer c the world bank data portal provides structured datasets accessible via apis the other options involve unstructured or imagebased content not suitable for direct data access module data preparation q data type conversion in excel you imported a csv file into excel and one of the columns containing numbers is treated as text what is the easiest way to convert it into numeric format a use the concat function b format the column as text c use the value function d use substitute answer c the value function converts text that appears as numbers into actual numeric values this is useful when data is imported with formatting issues module data analysis q outlier detection you are analyzing a dataset of employee salaries which visualization is best for quickly identifying outliers a line chart b box plot c histogram d pie chart answer b a box plot clearly shows the spread of data and highlights outliers as individual points beyond the whiskers module large language models q prompt engineering strategy to get consistent structured responses from a language model when extracting key information which approach is most effective a ask the model to summarize the text b use openended questions c use system messages and json schema formatting d provide only oneword inputs answer c system messages and structured output formats like json schemas guide the model to generate reliable and consistent structured responses module geospatial and network analysis q network centrality in a social network graph of coworkers which metric best identifies the person who connects the most groups together a degree centrality b closeness centrality c betweenness centrality d eigenvector centrality answer c betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other nodes highlighting connectors or bridges in the network module data visualization q choosing the right chart you want to show how the composition of a marketing budget changes across three years which visualization is most appropriate a pie charts for each year b scatter plots c stacked bar chart d line chart answer c a stacked bar chart shows parts of a whole across different categories and time periods making it easier to compare budget composition over years

I have similar concern
For Q1, I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

And got the following output:
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.

Dear TDS Team,
There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.

The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”
So I did. 

 Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments 
Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.
But let’s be real…
It was my Labrador who did the actual work 
While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots
Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing LLM bugs that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.
He growled at broken APIs.
I took the credit. 

 Message from the Dog Developer:

“Thank you all for an awesome semester!
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.
But I am personally offended by one thing…”


“How dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?
I skipped it — just like many — because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.
I demand justice. And a belly rub.”
– , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist


 Moral of the story:
Let your pets help with your coursework.
You get the grade. They get the rage.",sanand carlton saranshsaini jivraj students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments so i did confession my labrador did all my assignments yes i got great marks in assignments roes and project but lets be real it was my labrador who did the actual work while i was snoozing through deadlines he was solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots writing function calling code like a true gpt whisperer fixing llm bugs that i didnt even understand meanwhile i was just vibing in my blanket he growled at broken apis i took the credit message from the dog developer thank you all for an awesome semester i learned more than some juniors from containerization to prompt tuning but i am personally offended by one thing how dare you give bonus marks on week i skipped it just like many because we were told only best of would count i demand justice and a belly rub fullstack labrador parttime therapist moral of the story let your pets help with your coursework you get the grade they get the rage

I submitted the project within the deadline, and I ensured that all requirements were fulfilled, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.
However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.
Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.
Thank you for your understanding.
@Jivraj",screenshot kb i submitted the project within the deadline and i ensured that all requirements were fulfilled including correctly adding the mit license file the license file was named properly and contained the correct content however i received a message stating that the mit license was not present and that the prerequisites were not completed resulting in a failed status this is surprising and feels unfair as ive doublechecked my submission and confirmed that everything including the license file is in place and named correctly here is my github repo for your reference github virajpitaletdsproject i kindly request a reevaluation of my submission as i believe ive met all the required criteria i would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again thank you for your understanding jivraj

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.
But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.
Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.
These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.
Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.
We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.
I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you.

Dear TDS Team,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.
1. Graded Assignments (GA)


GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)


GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.


2. Project Updates

Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.
Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?  (thread link)

3. ROE Score Update

While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.

I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.

GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.


The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.
With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.
GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.



 lakshaygarg654:

Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.


Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.
Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.

3. ROE Score Update

While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.



You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.

The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.
We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.
Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Learner
Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:



exam.sanand.workers.dev


Technical Assessment





There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll(""textarea"")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll(""button"")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

Do not submit or save your answers.
All the best!
Kind regards
TDS Team
Update 2
26/02/2025 11:00 am
We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.
We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).
Kind regards,

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.
It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

The chaos of ROE.
The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly
Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.
Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).
I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.
However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.
Key Challenges Faced
 Lack of Prerequisites
This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.
 Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure
The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.
 Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback
Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience.
 Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)
While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.
We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.
We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.

Could you please look into the above issue?
Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:
Grading Concerns
Final Course Score:
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)
From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:
What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.
Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.
Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues

Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.

Request for Improvement
To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:

Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline.
More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.

I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.

This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.
Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.

TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:


This course is quite hard
Here’s students’ feedback:

It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # #
Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #
Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #
LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
The ROE is hard. #

Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.


TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help
Again to quote Anand:


We encourage learning by sharing
You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).
Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.
To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.
To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt.


Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).
Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.
Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.
Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.
@22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.

What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? Tools in Data Science


@ankit.jain – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. 
What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. 

Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. 
Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…

ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.
Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.
The problem is the lack of time.
So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.
Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.
Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.
The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.

Dear team,
Greetings of the day
I am writing this to request for a functionality

Practice the GAs again after their deadline has passed
Either the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.

How this is beneficial?

As the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time
Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term

Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.
Looking forward to your guidance and kind consideration

Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.
We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.
The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.
We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.
Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.
Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.
Here was my transcription - "" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.
In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”
The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.
Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.
From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.
Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation """,question i was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period after several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers i have tried all forms of repunctuations but the error wont budge i even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times i believe my answer is correct if not i wish to know what the correct answer is because compared to the video i have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between and seconds here was my transcription determined to confront the mystery miranda followed the elusive figure in the dim corridor fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike the pursuit led her to a narrow winding passage beneath the chapel in the oppressive darkness the air grew cold and heavy and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed in a subterranean chamber the shadow finally halted the figures voice emerged from the gloom you are close to the truth but be warned some secrets once uncovered can never be buried again the mysterious stranger introduced himself as victor a former confidant of edmund his words painted a tale of coercion and betrayala network of hidden alliances that had forced edmond into an impossible choice victor detailed clandestine meetings cryptic codes and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes miranda listened each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind from within his warm coat victor produced a faded journal brimming with names dates and enigmatic symbols its contents mirrored edmunds diary strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery the journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations mirandas pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit returning to the manors main hall miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations in the manors basement beneath a concealed panel miranda discovered another revelation

Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.
I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered

I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion:

We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.
All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)
Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)
We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.

All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:
Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.
Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.

We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -


Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.


Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.


Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py
Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile
which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.
So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):

You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000
You create a docker image that runs this application server.
You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.
For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:
evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.
Run evalute.py using uv.

If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.
Hope that gives clarity.

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.
Have you watched this session in particular?




If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it




followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases




But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.
Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.
Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint.

This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:


Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.


Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.


Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.




Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)

• Good for quick experimentation and testing.
• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.

Using requirements.txt

• Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.
Specifying Versions in requirements.txt
• If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.
• If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.
Handling Version Conflicts
• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.
• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:
• Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).
• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.
Best Practices Summary

Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility.
Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.
Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.

Kind regards",yes using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on python projects this approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment the main reasons why you should use virtual environments isolation each project has its own set of dependencies preventing conflicts with other projects reproducibility a virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies portability you can share a project with others or deploy it without worrying about systemwide package versions interfering installing with pip individually pip install packagename good for quick experimentation and testing not ideal for longterm project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time using requirementstxt best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install r requirementstxt avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developers setup specifying versions in requirementstxt if you dont specify a version pip install r requirementstxt will install the latest available versions which might introduce unexpected breaking changes if you do specify a version package you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues handling version conflicts if a package version fails to install try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall instead of completely omitting version numbers consider using greater thanless than constraints package allows updates but avoids major version changes running pip freeze requirementstxt after confirming a stable environment best practices summary always use a virtual environment eg venv or conda use a requirementstxt file for reproducibility pin versions cautiouslyavoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages kind regards

Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.

For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement





 24f2006531:

Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?


Coming to your second question,
The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.




 24f2006531:

My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation


The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.

Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator.  This is the basic prototype.
This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.
A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand, our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.
I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

Expand functionality and evaluation models.
Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!
Update: here is a video explaining the process - https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared
