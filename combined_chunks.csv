Notebooks: Google Colab
------------------------------------------------------------
Google Colab is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that’s become indispensable for data scientists and ML practitioners. It’s particularly valuable because it provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, and for easy sharing of code and execution results.
While Colab is excellent for prototyping and learning, its free tier has limitations - notebooks time out after 12 hours, and GPU access can be inconsistent.
Learn how to mount Google Drive for persistent storage, manage dependencies with !pip install commands, as these are common pain points when getting started.

How to define functions
The function definition is a JSON schema with a few OpenAI specific properties.
See the Supported schemas.
Here’s an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting:
MEETINGTOOL = {
    ""type"": ""function"",
    ""function"": {"
"MEETINGTOOL = {
    ""type"": ""function"",
    ""function"": {
        ""name"": ""schedulemeeting"",

        ""parameters"": {
            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""date"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format""
                },

            ""additionalProperties"": False
        },
        ""strict"": True
    }
}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
How to define multiple functions
You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the tools parameter.
Here’s an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses:
tools = [
    {
        ""type"": ""function"",
        ""function"": {
            ""name"": ""getexpensebalance"",
            ""description"": ""Get expense balance for an employee"",
            ""parameters"": {
                ""type"": ""object"",
                ""properties"": {
                    ""employeeid"": {"
"""properties"": {
                    ""employeeid"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Employee ID number""
                    }
                },
                ""required"": [""employeeid""],
                ""additionalProperties"": False
            },
            ""strict"": True
        }
    },
    {
        ""type"": ""function"",
        ""function"": {
            ""name"": ""calculateperformancebonus"",
            ""description"": ""Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee"",
            ""parameters"": {
                ""type"": ""object"",
                ""properties"": {
                    ""employeeid"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Employee ID number"""
"""description"": ""Employee ID number""
                    },
                    ""currentyear"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Year to calculate bonus for""
                    }
                },
                ""required"": [""employeeid"", ""currentyear""],
                ""additionalProperties"": False
            },
            ""strict"": True
        }
    }
]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Best Practices:
1. Use Strict Mode
    Always set strict: True to ensure valid function calls
    Define all required parameters
    Set additionalProperties: False
2. Use tool choice
    Set toolchoice: ""required"" to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools"
"Set toolchoice: ""required"" to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools
    The default is toolchoice: ""auto"" which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate
3. Clear Descriptions
    Write detailed function and parameter descriptions
    Include expected formats and units
    Mention any constraints or limitations
4. Error Handling
    Validate function inputs before execution
    Return clear error messages
    Handle missing or invalid parameters

LLM Video Screen-Scraping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Video screen-scraping with LLMs is a powerful technique for extracting structured data from screen recordings. This approach works with any visible screen content and bypasses traditional web scraping limitations like authentication or anti-scraping measures.
[](https://youtu.be/2G1LqS6qO5s)
Key benefits:
 No setup cost or authentication handling
 Works with any visible screen content
 Full control over data exposure
 Extremely cost-effective (< $0.001 per short video)
 Bypasses anti-scraping measures
 Handles varying formats and layouts
Quick Start Example
Here’s a basic workflow using Google’s AI Studio and Gemini:
1. Record the Screen"
"Here’s a basic workflow using Google’s AI Studio and Gemini:
1. Record the Screen
    Use QuickTime (Mac) or Windows Game Bar (Windows), Screen2Gif, or any tool of your choice
    Select specific screen area containing target data
    Record scrolling/clicking through content
    Keep recordings short (30-60 seconds)
2. Process with Gemini
    Upload to Google AI Studio
    Select Gemini 1.5 Flash (cost-effective)
    Prompt for structured output (JSON/CSV)
Example prompt for extracting tabular data:
Turn this video into a JSON array where each item has:
{
  ""date"": ""yyyy-mm-dd"",
  ""amount"": float
}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Cost Calculation
Gemini 1.5 Flash pricing (as of January 2025):
 $0.075 per million tokens
 Cost per frame ~ 250 tokens"
"$0.075 per million tokens
 Cost per frame ~ 250 tokens
 Cost for 24 hours of video at 1 frame per second ~ $1.62!
Best Practices
1. Recording Quality
    Frame only relevant content
    Pause briefly on important data
    Maintain consistent scroll speed
    Use high contrast display settings
2. Data Validation
    Always verify critical data manually
    Use spot-checking for large datasets
    Consider running multiple passes
    Log and review any anomalies
3. Error Handling
    Request data in simple formats (CSV/JSON)
    Include validation in prompts
    Split long videos into segments
    Handle missing/partial data gracefully

Vector Databases
----------------------------------------------------------
Vector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently.
Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON’T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.)
Vector databases are an evolving space.
The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:
 chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025
 qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025
 lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025
 faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025
 milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025"

 faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025
 milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025
 weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025
In addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:
 DuckDB: Supports vector search with vss.
 SQLite: Supports vector search with sqlite-vec.
 PostgreSQL: Supports vector search with pgvector.

Converting PDFs to Markdown
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).
Use Cases:
 LLM training and fine-tuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training
 Knowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents
 Content repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication"
"Content repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication
 Data extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis
 Accessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers
 Citation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers
 Documentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation
PyMuPDF4LLM"
"Documentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation
PyMuPDF4LLM
PyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.
PyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures."

Unstructured
Unstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.
GROBID
----------------------------------------------
If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, GROBID remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.
Start GROBID service

Mistral OCR API
Mistral OCR offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.
Azure Document Intelligence API
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, Azure Document Intelligence provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities.
Other libraries
Docling is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction."
"MegaParse takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.
Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PyMuPDF4LLM | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch | AI training data, semantic structure |
| Markitdown | Multi-format support, simple usage | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents |"
"| Unstructured | Wide format support, active development | Can be resource-intensive | Production pipelines, integration |
| GROBID | Reference extraction excellence | Narrower use case | Academic papers, citations |
| Docling | Advanced document understanding | Installation difficulties | Research applications |
| MegaParse | Comprehensive approach | Requires OpenAI API | Complex documents, OCR needs |
How to pick:
 Need LLM-ready content? PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this
 Working with multiple document formats? Markitdown handles diverse inputs
 Extracting academic references? GROBID remains the standard
 Building a production pipeline? Unstructured offers the best integration options"
"Building a production pipeline? Unstructured offers the best integration options
 Handling complex layouts? Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence
The optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.

JSON
----------------------
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the de facto standard format for data exchange on the web and APIs. Its human-readable format and widespread support make it essential for data scientists working with web services, APIs, and configuration files.
For data scientists, JSON is essential when:
 Working with REST APIs and web services
 Storing configuration files and metadata
 Parsing semi-structured data from databases like MongoDB
 Creating data visualization specifications (e.g., Vega-Lite)
Watch this comprehensive introduction to JSON (15 min):

Key concepts to understand in JSON:
 JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects"
"JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects
 You can nest data. Arrays and objects can contain other data types, including other arrays and objects
 Always validate. Ensure JSON is well-formed. Comm errors: Trailing commas, missing quotes, and escape characters
JSON Lines is a format that allows you to store multiple JSON objects in a single line.
It’s useful for logging and streaming data.
Tools you could use with JSON:
 JSONLint: Validate and format JSON
 JSON Editor Online: Visual JSON editor and formatter
 JSON Schema: Define the structure of your JSON data
 jq: Command-line JSON processor
Common Python operations with JSON:
import json
Parse JSON string
jsonstr = '{""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}'
data = json.loads(jsonstr)"
"import json
Parse JSON string
jsonstr = '{""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}'
data = json.loads(jsonstr)
Convert to JSON string
jsonstr = json.dumps(data, indent=2)
Read JSON from file
with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
Write JSON to file
with open('output.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
Read JSON data a Pandas DataFrame. JSON data is typically stored as an array of objects.

Serverless hosting: Vercel
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They’re perfect for small web tools that don’t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses:
 A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)
 A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)
 A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)
 A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)"
"A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)
 A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)
You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!"
"Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:
 You can’t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt
 You can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.

Gemini transcription
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Gemini models from Google are notable in two ways:
1. They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.
2. They can handle audio input.
This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.
LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:
1. Transcribe into other languages. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step."
"2. Summarize audio transcripts. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.
3. Legal Proceeding Analysis. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.
4. Medical Consultation Summary. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.
Here’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.
1. Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
2. Set the GEMINIAPIKEY environment variable to the API key.
3. Set the MP3FILE environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe.
4. Run this code:

Unicode
-------------------------------
Ever noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.
Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.
Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly."
"Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.
Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:
 Character Encodings: Different ways to represent text in computers
  + ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only
  + UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII
  + UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java
  + UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple
Common encoding issues you’ll encounter:
Reading files with explicit encoding
with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:"
"Reading files with explicit encoding

Hybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation.

Key Concepts:
1. HTTP Methods
    GET: Retrieve data
    POST: Create new data
    PUT/PATCH: Update existing data
    DELETE: Remove data
2. Status Codes
    2xx: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
    4xx: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
    5xx: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error)

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They are fundamental to web development and data scraping, allowing you to precisely target elements for styling or extraction.
For data scientists, understanding CSS selectors is crucial when:
 Web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
 Selecting elements for browser automation with Selenium
 Styling data visualizations and web applications
 Debugging website issues using browser DevTools

LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.
[](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)
What Makes an Agent?
An LLM agent consists of three core components:
1. LLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next
2. Tools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)
3. Memory: Retains context across multiple steps"
"3. Memory: Retains context across multiple steps
Agents operate through a loop:
 Observe the environment
 Think about what to do
 Take action using tools
 Observe results
 Repeat until task completion
Command-Line Agent Example
We’ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that:
1. Takes a task description from the command line
2. Generates code to accomplish the task
3. Automatically extracts and executes the code
4. Passes the results back to the LLM
5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails
Here’s how it works:
uv run llm-cmd-agent.py ""list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size""
uv run llm-cmd-agent.py ""convert the largest Markdown file to HTML""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
The agent will:"
"The agent will:
1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes
2. Execute the script in a subprocess
3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)
4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation
5. Present a final answer to the user
Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow:
1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script
2. Code extraction from the LLM response
3. Code execution in a subprocess
4. Result interpretation by the LLM
5. Error handling and retry logic if needed
This demonstrates the core agent loop of:
 Planning (generating code)
 Execution (running the code)
 Reflection (interpreting results)
 Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)
Agent Architectures
Different agent architectures exist for different use cases:"
"Agent Architectures
Different agent architectures exist for different use cases:
1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions
2. Reflexion: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning
3. MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules
4. Plan-and-Execute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps
Real-World Applications
LLM agents can be applied to various domains:
1. Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information
2. Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code
3. Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data
4. Customer service agents that handle queries and perform actions
5. Personal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks
Project Ideas"
"5. Personal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks
Project Ideas
Here are some practical agent projects you could build:
1. Study buddy agent: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts
2. Job application assistant: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses
3. Personal finance agent: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities
4. Health and fitness coach: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation
5. Course project helper: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work
Best Practices
1. Clear instructions: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations
2. Effective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable"
"2. Effective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable
3. Robust error handling: Agents should recover gracefully from failures
4. Memory management: Balance context retention with token efficiency
5. User feedback: Allow users to correct or guide the agent
Limitations and Challenges
Current LLM agents face several challenges:
1. Hallucination: Agents may generate false information or tool calls
2. Planning limitations: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities
3. Tool integration complexity: Each new tool adds implementation overhead
4. Context window constraints: Limited memory for long-running tasks
5. Security concerns: Tool access requires careful permission management

Parsing JSON
----------------------------------------------
JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.
For example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.
[](https://youtu.be/1lxrbezP-g)
This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:
| Tool | Extract from JSON… | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jq | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |"
"| --- | --- | --- |
| jq | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |
| JMESPath | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax |
| ijson | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently |
| Pandas | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data |
| SQL JSON | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data |
| DuckDB | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |
Examples:
 Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.
 Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.
 Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.

 DuckDB JSON Tutorial: Learn DuckDB JSON functions
Command-line JSON Processing with jq
jq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.
Example: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.
Extract specific fields from JSONL
cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == ""user"") | {id, name}'
Transform JSON structure
cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'
Filter and aggregate"
"cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'
Filter and aggregate
cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'groupby(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
JMESPath Queries
JMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.
Example: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.
import jmespath
Example queries
data = {
    ""locations"": [
        {""name"": ""Seattle"", ""state"": ""WA"", ""info"": {""population"": 737015}},"
"""locations"": [
        {""name"": ""Seattle"", ""state"": ""WA"", ""info"": {""population"": 737015}},
        {""name"": ""Portland"", ""state"": ""OR"", ""info"": {""population"": 652503}}
    ]
}
Find all cities with population > 700000
cities = jmespath.search(""locations[?info.population > 700000].name"", data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Streaming with ijson
Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.
Example: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.
import ijson
async def processlargejson(filepath: str) -> list:"
"import ijson
async def processlargejson(filepath: str) -> list:
    """"""Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.""""""
    results = []
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
        Stream objects under the 'items' key
        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')
        async for item in parser:
            if item['value'] > 100:  Process conditionally
                results.append(item)
    return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Pandas JSON Columns
Pandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations."
"Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.
import pandas as pd
Parse JSON strings in a column
df = pd.DataFrame({'jsoncol': ['{""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}', '{""name"": ""Bob"", ""age"": 25}']})
df['parsed'] = df['jsoncol'].apply(pd.jsonnormalize)
Normalize nested JSON columns
df = pd.readcsv('data.csv')
dfnormalized = pd.jsonnormalize(
    df['nestedjson'].apply(json.loads),
    recordpath=['items'],        List of nested objects to unpack
    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      Keep these columns from parent
)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
SQL JSON Functions
SQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases."
"These are implemented by most popular databases, including
SQLite,
PostgreSQL, and
MySQL.
This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.
Example: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.
SELECT
    jsonextract(data, '$.name') as name,
    jsonextract(data, '$.details.age') as age

DuckDB JSON Processing
DuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.
Example: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.
SELECT
    jsonextractstring(data, '$.user.name') as name,
    avg(jsonextractfloat(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avgvalue

"CORS.md
CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.
Watch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):
[](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0)
Key CORS concepts:
 Same-Origin Policy: Browsers block requests between different origins by default
 CORS Headers: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests
 Preflight Requests: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed"
"Preflight Requests: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed
 Credentials: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication
If you’re exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: .
Here are other common CORS headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
To implement CORS in FastAPI, use the CORSMiddleware middleware:
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
app = FastAPI()"
"from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
app = FastAPI()
app.addmiddleware(CORSMiddleware, alloworigins=[""""]) Allow GET requests from all origins
Or, provide more granular control:
app.addmiddleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    alloworigins=[""https://example.com""],  Allow a specific domain
    allowcredentials=True,  Allow cookies
    allowmethods=[""GET"", ""POST"", ""PUT"", ""DELETE""],  Allow specific methods
    allowheaders=[""""],  Allow all headers
)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Testing CORS with JavaScript:
// Simple request
const response = await fetch(""https://api.example.com/data"", {
  method: ""GET"",
  headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"" },
});
// Request with credentials
const response = await fetch(""https://api.example.com/data"", {"
"});
// Request with credentials
const response = await fetch(""https://api.example.com/data"", {
  credentials: ""include"",
  headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"" },
});Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Useful CORS debugging tools:
 CORS Checker: Test CORS configurations
 Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests
 cors-anywhere: CORS proxy for development
Common CORS errors and solutions:
 No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header: Configure server to send proper CORS headers
 Request header field not allowed: Add required headers to Access-Control-Allow-Headers
 Credentials flag: Set both credentials: 'include' and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
 Wild card error: Cannot use  with credentials; specify exact origins

"Multimodal_Embeddings.md
Multimodal Embeddings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multimodal embeddings map text and images into the same vector space, enabling direct comparison between, say, a caption — “A cute cat” — and an image of that cat. This unified representation powers real-world applications like:
 Cross-modal search (e.g. “find images of a sunset” via text queries)
 Content recommendation (suggesting visually similar products to text descriptions)
 Clustering & retrieval (grouping documents and their associated graphics)
 Anomaly detection (spotting unusual image–text pairings)
By reducing different data types to a common numeric form, you unlock richer search, enhanced recommendations, and tighter integration of visual and textual data."

Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let’s assume it’s at https://app.example.com/api/.
The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.
For example, here’s how anyone can make a request:
curl ""https://app.example.com/api/"" \

OpenAI’s Text-to-Speech API (TTS-1) converts text into natural-sounding speech using state-of-the-art neural models. Released in March 2025, it offers multiple voices and control over speaking style and speed.
[](https://youtu.be/lXb0L16ISAc)
Simple speech generation
To generate speech from text, send a POST request to the speech endpoint:
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $OPENAIAPIKEY"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{
    ""model"": ""tts-1"",
    ""input"": ""Hello! This is a test of the OpenAI text to speech API."",
    ""voice"": ""alloy"""
"""input"": ""Hello! This is a test of the OpenAI text to speech API."",
    ""voice"": ""alloy""
  }' --output speech.mp3Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Generation options
Control the output with these parameters:
 model: tts-1 (standard) or tts-1-hd (higher quality)
 input: Text to convert (max 4096 characters)
 voice: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, or shimmer
 responseformat: mp3 (default), opus, aac, or flac
 speed: 0.25 to 4.0 (default 1.0)
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $OPENAIAPIKEY"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{
    ""model"": ""tts-1-hd"",
    ""input"": ""Welcome to our podcast! Today we will be discussing artificial intelligence."",
    ""voice"": ""nova"",
    ""responseformat"": ""mp3"",
    ""speed"": 1.2"
"""voice"": ""nova"",
    ""responseformat"": ""mp3"",
    ""speed"": 1.2
  }' --output podcastintro.mp3Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Costs and optimization
Pricing per 1,000 characters:
 tts-1: $0.015
 tts-1-hd: $0.030
To optimize costs:
 Use tts-1 for drafts, tts-1-hd for final versions

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning.
In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:
Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
Answer: fat arrow"
"Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
Answer: fat arrow
Q=""What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?""
Answer: node.getChildren()
Q=""What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?""
Answer: trivia
Q=""Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?""
Answer: !!Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.
1. Clone the repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book
cd typescript-bookCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 --depth 1 fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.
 cd typescript-book moves into the project folder."
"cd typescript-book moves into the project folder.
You’ll now be in a new folder typescript-book containing the repo.

Robots.txt
robots.txt is a standard file found in a website’s root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It’s part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.
Why it’s important:
 Server load protection: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers
 Privacy protection: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed
 Legal compliance: Respects website owners’ rights to control access to their content
 Ethical web citizenship: Shows respect for website administrators’ wishes
How to override robots.txt restrictions:
 wget, wget2: Use -e robots=off
 httrack: Use -s0"
"How to override robots.txt restrictions:
 wget, wget2: Use -e robots=off
 httrack: Use -s0
 wpull: Use --no-robots
When to override robots.txt (use with discretion):
Only bypass robots.txt when:
 You have explicit permission from the website owner
 You’re crawling your own website
 The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won’t cause server issues
 You’re conducting authorized security testing
Remember that bypassing robots.txt without legitimate reason may:
 Violate terms of service
 Lead to IP banning
 Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions
 Cause reputation damage to your organization
Always use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.

Google Authentication with FastAPI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secure your API endpoints using Google ID tokens to restrict access to specific email addresses.
[](https://youtu.be/4ExQYRCwbzw)
Google Auth is the most commonly implemented single sign-on mechanism because:
 It’s popular and user-friendly. Users can log in with their existing Google accounts.
 It’s secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication.
Here’s how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user.
1. Go to the Google Cloud Console – Credentials and click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID.
2. Choose Web application, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:8000/)."
"2. Choose Web application, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:8000/).
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into a .env file:
   
   GOOGLECLIENTID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLECLIENTSECRET=your-client-secretCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
4. Create your FastAPI app.py:
/// script
dependencies = [""python-dotenv"", ""fastapi"", ""uvicorn"", ""itsdangerous"", ""httpx"", ""authlib""]
///
import os
from dotenv import loaddotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse
from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware
from authlib.integrations.starletteclient import OAuth
loaddotenv()
app = FastAPI()
app.addmiddleware(SessionMiddleware, secretkey=""create-a-random-secret-key"")
oauth = OAuth()"
"app.addmiddleware(SessionMiddleware, secretkey=""create-a-random-secret-key"")
oauth = OAuth()
oauth.register(
    name=""google"",

    clientkwargs={""scope"": ""openid email profile""},
)
@app.get(""/"")
async def application(request: Request):
    user = request.session.get(""user"")
    3. For authenticated users: say hello
    if user:

    2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session
    if ""code"" in request.queryparams:

        request.session[""user""] = token[""userinfo""]"
"request.session[""user""] = token[""userinfo""]
        return RedirectResponse(""/"")
    1. For users who are logging in for the first time, redirect to Google login

Marimo is a new take on notebooks that solves some headaches of Jupyter. It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.
Marimo’s cells can’t be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.
It also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. Browse the gallery of examples. With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It’s growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps.

"Images__Compression.md
Images: Compression
----------------------------------------------------------------
Image compression is essential when deploying apps. Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.
Here are things you should know when you’re compressing images:
 Image dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot
 Lossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data
 Lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files
 Vector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss
 WebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless
Here’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025."
"Here’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.
 Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one)
 Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP
Common operations with Python:
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import io
async def compressimage(inputpath: Path, outputpath: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:
    """"""Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.""""""
    with Image.open(inputpath) as img:
        Convert RGBA to RGB if needed
        if img.mode == 'RGBA':
            img = img.convert('RGB')
        Optimize for web
        img.save(outputpath, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)

"Base_64_Encoding.md
Base 64 Encoding
=========================================================
Base64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.
Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):
[](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)
Here’s how it works:
 It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters
 … using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4)
 There’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \ to avoid issues in URLs
 Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)
Common Python operations with Base64:
import base64
Basic encoding/decoding"
"Common Python operations with Base64:
import base64
Basic encoding/decoding
text = ""Hello, World!""
Convert text to base64
encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
Convert base64 back to text
decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        Hello, World!
Convert to URL-safe base64
urlsafe = base64.urlsafeb64encode(text.encode()).decode()  SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
Working with binary files (e.g., images)
with open('image.png', 'rb') as f:
    binarydata = f.read()
    imageb64 = base64.b64encode(binarydata).decode()
Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)
datauri = f""data:image/png;base64,{imageb64}""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied"
"datauri = f""data:image/png;base64,{imageb64}""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.
For example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI:
<img
  src=""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+""

"4._Data_Sourcing.md
Data Sourcing
=================================================
Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it.
And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data.
There are three ways you can get the data.
1. The first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data."
"2. The second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.
3. The third way is you have to scrape it. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there."
"In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

"Convert_HTML_to_Markdown.md
Converting HTML to Markdown
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:
 Content analysis: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing
 Data mining: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content
 Offline reading: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption
 Content migration: Move content between different CMS platforms
 SEO analysis: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization
 Archive creation: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats"
"Archive creation: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats
 Accessibility: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers
This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line.
defuddle-cli
defuddle-cli specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.
find . -name '.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied"
"find . -name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
 -exec ... \;: Executes the following command for each file found
 npx --package defuddle-cli -y: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting
 defuddle parse {} --md: Parses the HTML file (represented by {}) and converts to markdown
 -o {}.md: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension
Pandoc
Pandoc is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.
Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.
[](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)"
"[](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)
find . -name '.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdownstrict -o {}.md {} \;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
 find . -name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
 -exec ... \;: Executes the following command for each file found
 pandoc: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion
 -f html -t markdownstrict: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown
 -o {}.md {}: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument
Lynx
Lynx is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files."
"find . -type f -name '.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist ""$f"" > ""${f%.html}.txt""; done'  {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied

 for f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch
 lynx -dump -nolist ""$f"": Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text
  + -dump: Output the rendered page to stdout
  + -nolist: Don’t include the list of links at the end
 > ""${f%.html}.txt"": Save output to a .txt file with the same base name
w3m"
"> ""${f%.html}.txt"": Save output to a .txt file with the same base name
w3m
w3m is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.
find . -type f -name '.html' \
  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \
      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph ""$f"" > ""${f%.html}.md""; \
    done'  {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied

3. Customize output format with additional parameters:
   
   For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting
   find . -name "".html"" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
4. Handle errors gracefully:

 Need precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc"
"Need precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc
 Need a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddle-cli
 Working with complex tables? w3m might render them better
Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.
Combined Crawling and Conversion
Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler.
1. For research/data collection: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion
2. For simple website archiving: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution
3. For high-quality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion"
"3. For high-quality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion
4. For maximum speed: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline
Crawl4AI
Crawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.

markdown-crawler
markdown-crawler combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It’s efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting.

"Embeddings.md
Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.
This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:
1. Search. Find similar documents to a query.
2. Classification. Classify text into categories.
3. Clustering. Group similar items into clusters.
4. Anomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text."
"4. Anomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text.
You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.
| Feature | Local Models | API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Privacy | High | Dependent on provider |
| Cost | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go |
| Scale | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |
| Quality | Varies by model | Typically high |
The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:
1. Rank. Higher ranked models have higher quality.
2. Memory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run."
"2. Memory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.
3. Embedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.
4. Max Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input.
5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.
Local Embeddings
[](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)
Here’s a minimal example using a local embedding model:
/// script
requires-python = ""==3.12""
dependencies = [
""sentence-transformers"",
""httpx"",
""numpy"",
]
///
from sentencetransformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np"
"""httpx"",
""numpy"",
]
///
from sentencetransformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np
model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  A small, high quality model
async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:
    """"""Get embedding vector for text using local model.""""""
    return model.encode(text).tolist()
async def getsimilarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
    """"""Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.""""""
    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))
    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))
    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1)  np.linalg.norm(emb2)))
async def main():
    print(await getsimilarity(""Apple"", ""Orange""))
    print(await getsimilarity(""Apple"", ""Lightning""))
if name == ""main"":
    import asyncio"
"print(await getsimilarity(""Apple"", ""Lightning""))
if name == ""main"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Note the getsimilarity function. It uses a Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.
OpenAI Embeddings
For comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the embed function in the earlier script:
import os
import httpx
async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:
    """"""Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.""""""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            ""https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings"",
            headers={""Authorization"": f""Bearer {os.environ['OPENAIAPIKEY']}""},"
"headers={""Authorization"": f""Bearer {os.environ['OPENAIAPIKEY']}""},
            json={""model"": ""text-embedding-3-small"", ""input"": text}
        )
        return response.json()[""data""][0][""embedding""]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
NOTE: You need to set the OPENAIAPIKEY environment variable for this to work.

Database: SQLite
-----------------------------------------------
Relational databases are used to store data in a structured way. You’ll often access databases created by others for analysis.
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is SQLite. It’s embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It’s lightweight but very scalable and powerful.
Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it’s used in Python (34 min):

There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Redis, etc. that you should know about and we may cover later.

yes i also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses however awarding a mark bonus instead of a percentilebased system like ga seems quite different is this information available to everyone carlton sir"
Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
hello carlton jivraj saranshsaini sanand sir i hope you are doing well as per the grading document we were informed that only the best out of the assessments would be considered for grading however there was no mention of bonus marks and before the deadline we were not informed about the bonus marks for ga due to other academic commitments such as project some of us were unable to complete ga now we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded bonus marks which directly contribute to the final score in some cases this may even impact the final grade since this information was not communicated earlier we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed ga to earn these bonus marksperhaps through
providing an alternative way for those who missed ga to earn these bonus marksperhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment we sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well looking forward to your kind consideration best regards digvijaysinh chudasama

sanand carlton same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter"
Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton sanand there seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the ga marking scheme which feels quite arbitrary initially we were told that ga would carry weight calculated as the best out of based on this after scoring full marks in four gas i didnt attempt the rest even then i did complete ga and ga which you can verify now im seeing in groups that theres an extra benefit being given for ga if any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse transparency is important and as students we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance i could point out several other issues but to keep it brief grading should be fair and consistent every student deserves an equal opportunity and if ga is being considered
be fair and consistent every student deserves an equal opportunity and if ga is being considered differently everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly carlton we request you to kindly consider this matter we are looking forward to a quick response hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton sir this would be a deviation from the grading format right sir as some of us were proactive and closed the ga requirement earlier if such extra weightage is given to a certain ga unannounced then how is it fair on the other students kindly consider"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
same for me also please consider all the ga for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in gas instead of one ga carlton jivraj saranshsaini"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
exactly this should have been informed beforehand its really unfair"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
it the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week like all the gas were equally important so please do something about this"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton jivraj saranshsaini sanand i have completed gas but missed others due to the time commitment required along with managing three other subjects and one project i kindly request that bonus marks be awarded to all as the additional marks for ga were not communicated earlier this could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for ga thank you for considering this regards akash"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton i genuinely wish i could respond more humbly but the way this has unfolded makes it hard and sadly im not msd to handle it all with silence and a smile"
Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
good evening carlton jivraj saranshsaini sanand sir i hope you are well according to the grading document we were told that only the best out of the assessments would count towards our final grade there was no mention of any bonus marks and we were not informed about the bonus marks for ga before the deadline because of other academic commitments like project some of us couldnt complete ga recently we found out that some students received an email saying theyve been given bonus marks for ga which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade since this information wasnt shared earlier we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed ga to earn the bonus marks this could be through a submission review or another form of assessment we
to earn the bonus marks this could be through a submission review or another form of assessment we genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too best regards palaash v upadhyay

"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton jivraj saranshsaini yes sir we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week we feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on week or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given please do consider our request thank you"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
exactly they have to informed this earlier that week have peer marks too and now bonus too in the grading doc they removed peer marks so i thought it was removed but its not"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton jivraj saranshsaini sanand the sudden introduction of bonus marks for ga in tools in data science has left many students confused as there was no prior intimation regarding this change we had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated best out of policy this unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted it is a fundamental right for every student we respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing we hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton jivraj saranshsaini sanand yes sir i also completed gas even tho it was written only best out of gas would be considered for final grade but couldnt complete ga due to pressure of other subjects if it was written in the grading document i would have done it hoping you would understand sir please do consider our request thank you"
"Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25
carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best out of assignments but i did gas but skipped ga due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that bonus marks are given in ga which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did ga are the one who were not able to complete previous gas so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge if it was announced before deadline of ga it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so please come with the best possible solution for this thanking you waiting for your answer"
"Repeat course
even if i pass in end term tds can i repeat the course in next term because i missed project and my cgpa will go down because of it this is my last term of diploma so can i take diploma course and rest degree courses in next term"
"Repeat course
yes you can more details given in student handbook search for repeat courses kb"
"Repeat course
tds is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve cgpa its better to take a high credit easy course to improve cgpa we never recommend taking tds for grade improvement if you have passed it its better to move on"
"Repeat course
carlton sir it is my humble request to kindly give atleast bonus marks like any other subject if i will get marks as bonus my grade will stay good otherwise it will fall badly sir plzzz it is my request"
"Repeat course
just as matter of interest even on campus iitm mtech students take foundation python course from bs program to artificially improve their on campus cgpa they take it as an elective so if the cgpa is that big a deal do an easy credit course and get an s dont repeat hard subjects thats just a waste of time"
"Repeat course
this is not up to us we make adjustments within assignments and projects and we have done that already for course level bonuses that is the discretion of operations"

Project 1 discrepancy regarding mit license
ds f i completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues but the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix we have to apply the rule uniformly unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible these things do matter when done at scale its an important lesson anand wants students to understand these minor things matter its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot minor detail costs rs but the rocket cannot leave without it we had a significant discussion about it internally for the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right we cannot allow edits after the project deadline
the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right we cannot allow edits after the project deadline it makes the prerequisites meaningless especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the project page i know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and i have shared the reasons why kindest regards

project deliverables are all that matter how you accomplish them is not very relevant the keys to a successful project are deliverables and an example of the evaluation has been provided if your project runs in accordance with the evaluation methodology then it is considered screenshot at am kb please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom so the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation the whole point is for it to run not just on your system it should be deployable anywhere on any machine your solution should work anywhere we test it thats why you package it in a docker container how you achieve that is up to you but if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this
run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test kind regards

lakshaygarg ga platform changes initially we were solving questions on examsanandworkersdev however in ga we moved to seek and in ga to google forms the issue is that in ga we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments the course is in transition initially all of it used to be on seek portal but there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive reactive and rapid correctionsiterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the tds server since the move to the new tds server on the back end we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised this is not possible on seek portal for us the results are immediate to see you got
are raised this is not possible on seek portal for us the results are immediate to see you got timely rapid feedback for ga to ga from the tas the tas were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations with ga our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately its possible but it has to take a very circuitous route via set of people meant we were always on the back foot for both checking the answers as well as making any corrections and since the questions were parameterised for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersomeriskyimpossible to make changes without it being very disruptive to all students these were some of the reasons we are transitioning we have seen this problem term after term in prior terms
some of the reasons we are transitioning we have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal this is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like tds ga was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above ga was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation whereas ga is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in seek portal since it was not possible in such a short time to transition ga to our preferred hosting server and student favourite we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon lakshaygarg project the result is still awaited although it was expected on or before march any
lakshaygarg project the result is still awaited although it was expected on or before march any update on this would be helpful project evaluations is very computationally intensive for us to evaluate each project although dockerised with an average submission weighing at gb we have to provision space of tb along with the cloud computer resources for all of that ram and vcpus and if you thought creating project was tough you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix in truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical so while we are moving the course along we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines we are taking the matter with
that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines we are taking the matter with utmost seriousness its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing each and everyone of us are concerned about project and are working on it anand jk prasanna myself jivraj and saransh we all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious tds project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway lakshaygarg roe score update while roe scores may not be a primary concern the bonus marks in roe have still not

f we will have it uploaded sometime this morning it has two parts to it the first part is the tas solving the mock in real time however this is not a solutions session the purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things the chaos of roe the adrenaline speed of thought the need to be very familiar with your tools the limited time you have to use gpt effectively it will help you with minor work flows but not with complex tasks watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this the value of efficient and effective collaboration a hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team the absolute importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve roe quickly workflow of roe data extraction data cleaning data
snippets that will help you solve roe quickly workflow of roe data extraction data cleaning data transformation data analyisis information to answer questions the pitfalls of getting fixated on a question a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well how limited the time is the second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt the goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of roe past terms never had this benefit we thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before emotions were raw but this is normal what is unusual is to have a preview of it before roe so the discussions were very intense even for us todays mock roe will be more like a traditional solving session
were very intense even for us todays mock roe will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects it has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server without a time limit i would still strongly advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of roe you will make stupid mistakes under pressure the tas did yesterday as well so best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock kind regards

Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness
dear jkmadathil anand bharathi first and foremost we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the tds team in supporting us throughout this course the live sessions and guidance have been helpful and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience however despite these efforts many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations key challenges faced lack of prerequisites this course did not list any prerequisites leading many studentsincluding those from nontechnical backgroundsto enroll with the expectation that they could keep up however the reality is that the course content assignments and projects have been far more complex than anticipated making it difficult to manage project complexity deadline pressure the difficulty of the
making it difficult to manage project complexity deadline pressure the difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines despite putting in our best efforts many of us struggled to complete them successfully course structure changes misleading past feedback many students joined tds based on past discourse posts and feedback which suggested a different course structure with the recent changes it has been a tough transitionespecially for working professionals and students without prior experience remote open exam roe graded assignments gas while we have put in significant effortspending days on graded assignments gas to secure good scoreswe still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and
to secure good scoreswe still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and roe which are significantly harder than anticipated we completely understand the need to maintain academic standards but we also hope fairness is considered since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern increasing the weightage of graded assignments gas would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades this would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course we truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and
that has gone into designing this course and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow we only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed thank you for your time and understanding we appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives

in the week of the deadline this was highly inconvenient as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns as a result many students are at risk of losing a valuable marks for project course structuring scheduling issues many students pursuing this course are dualdegree students or working professionals making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines the lastminute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments the structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate with crucial guidance sessions being held too late making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time request for improvement to ensure a smoother learning experience i request early guidance and

Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness
thank you alakshmi for the detailed post this is much appreciated thought of quickly stepping in before anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response let me be open and blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed and the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the op tds team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past terms you can check this discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject in fact the first page of the tds course ga itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead anand has explicitly written down the below words this course is quite hard heres students
ahead anand has explicitly written down the below words this course is quite hard heres students feedback it used to be an easy course until now its hard and covers more take it in your last semester if possible plan extra time it takes more time than typical credit courses llms grade you unpredictably the roe is hard take graded assignment to check if youre ready for this course please drop this course do it in a later term if you score low itll be too tough for you now tds or for that matter any course in this degree program is not supposed to be a single person effort you should be realizing this even in your real life a significant part of our learning process is social by nature the only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate if there is one
difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate if there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this surviving tough situations require support all around us and there is no shame in asking for help again to quote anand we encourage learning by sharing you can copy from friends you can work in groups you can share code even in projects assignments and exams except the final endterm exam why should you copy because in real life theres no time to reinvent the wheel youll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants its important to learn how to do that well to learn well understand what youre copying if youre short of time prioritize to learn better teach what youve learnt now will be a good point to reflect on
of time prioritize to learn better teach what youve learnt now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of grades versus learning the larger question for each of you is to consider the shortterm advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage not just for data science but in every day life itself once again anand has a nice blog where i think he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us this is a journey that all of us are taking together and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning or teaching experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble whether you like it or not life is becoming more complex day
and internally make us more humble whether you like it or not life is becoming more complex day by day and unless you figure out your optimization strategy it is going to be a bumpy ride and this is true even for the tds course team members each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities some even doing projects in this term while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners this is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here then the major question will be why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way the simplest answer is tools are evolving day by day and unless we realize that they are just tools it is going to consume us an eternity to master them the
unless we realize that they are just tools it is going to consume us an eternity to master them the point of all the exercises and assessments is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them f management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility all of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy in fact we have released all major content well in advance so that learners can benefit from early access and from our side we also have realized the supporting learners wouldnt be easy but i see that the tds course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course and support and even in this week they have prepared sets of roes in order to ensure that all
and support and even in this week they have prepared sets of roes in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity
Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness
regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning i think im speaking for a lot of my peers that were not concerned about grades at this point we just at least want to pass this course im a standalone degree potential student and while i have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down but at least after all this hard work i should be able to pass the course while grades dont matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks i want to invest myself in the roe and the remaining project but at this point im so frustrated about getting at least that rather than a valuable learning experience this course seems like a burden to me i
at least that rather than a valuable learning experience this course seems like a burden to me i understand that the grading cant be changed all i hope and request that project and end term turn out to be more approachable than project and roe so that after all this hard work students like me at least get the privilege to pass

it is not mandatory to attempt mocks at pm but we will solve it in real time during the session thats why we are releasing it hour before we will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later roe is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities the truth is everyone can get full marks for roe given enough time the problem is the lack of time so if you want to really check roe readiness fix the timer alarm for mins and attempt it genuinely within the mins only then will you know where you stand additionally each roe is completely different from the next if you manage to do good in one is zero guarantee that you will do good in the next thats why do all mock roes roe is
good in one is zero guarantee that you will do good in the next thats why do all mock roes roe is not like any other exam other exams have the same types of questions not with roe the real roe will be also something that no one has seen before but we will help you be as ready as possible for it kind regards

carlton if possible could you inform what weeks the project would be based on like project was based on week content thanks in advance"
Project 2 and Week 6 assignment
project was based on module through project will encompass module through and possibly but not to the exclusion of the prior modules these are not set in stone and still is in the designvalidation phase we generally avoid calling it week content etc because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started the gas are released as we complete validations on them each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations so they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in years or more we try to release gas so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible but rarely do other subjects
the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible but rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their gas hence we have situations even in past terms where gas and projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers in spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system hope that give you some insight into how tds works thanks for bearing with us tds is perpetually a wip kind regards

thanks for the answer carlton is it safe to assume that roe is nothing but a ga with extremely short deadline since we dont have proctors or is the roe more complex structured ps i am not saying the questions will be hard or easy just asking about structure"
"ROE instructions request
sir questions will be of numeeical type or mcqs type as in earlier batches it was mcqs"
"ROE instructions request
roes are always unique they can be of any kind we do not fix one method therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether mcq msq or numerical or text etc kind regards"
ROE instructions request
the roes are not gas with short deadlines a ga question usually tests one concept in isolation roes typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question in a very short time if your goal is totally rely on the llm to solve it for you past experience shows us that roes complexity is usually difficult for an llm to overcome without significant assistance from the hooomann so practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time collaboration with others is going be helpful roe is not proctored and is open internet there is a reason for that its very hard there will be a dataset or multiple datasets sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions
be a dataset or multiple datasets sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions you will have to extract data from the dataset you will have to transformclean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data is what typical roes test kind regards
"ROE instructions request
is there scope for collaboration in a minute test"
"ROE instructions request
depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks if its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly in practise though that rarely happens also mins is not a given its a typical time we aim for it can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the roe each one is unique there have been roes as long as hours and on the minimum side mins"

so the reason for the failure is you had initially put your dockerfile inside a directory called tdspmain instead of being directly in your repo on th feb am then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections then once you realised your mistake on feb th at pm ist ie yesteday you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations then you finally posted here on discourse with the image quotef post topic image kb quote showing that your files are in the correct place we do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students kind regards

sessions on youtube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it all of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned considering all the above including the concerns mentioned by students project deadline will not be changed please make sure to carefully read the deliverables and the evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to week session to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required watch week both sessions to see how we construct these requirements kind regards tds team

"Sudo permission needed to create data folder in root?
jivraj carlton sir please help when i am downloading the data folder after processing datagenpy it is trying to download in root folder and it is facing permission error how can we overcome this needs sudo permission all the time image kb"
Sudo permission needed to create data folder in root?
hi vikram this is because if you watched the session or examined the code you would have realised that datagenpy was designed to run inside your docker container and datagenpy or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task a will normally be called by evaluatepy inside the docker container permission for the data folder is set by the dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the data folder so the workflow is like this for your internal testing only please follow the project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully you create your application server that serves endpoints on localhost you create a docker image that runs this
your application server that serves endpoints on localhost you create a docker image that runs this application server you run the docker image using podman as described in the project page for mimicking the testing conditions you need two files evaluatepy and datagenpy to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts run evalutepy using uv if your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured then all the tasks run by evaluatepy will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task hope that gives clarity kind regards

LLM what rocket science going on here
hi hari the goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies with perhaps the exception of llms as major tooling capability for data science due to the volume of the content in the first weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the graded assignments one of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics so it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions this is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions we cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved we can only guess the
gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved we can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students the quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended have you watched this session in particular if thats insufficient for you last term we did a hr min session on just introducing it followed by another hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases but of course does everyone want to watch hours of sessions to understand it that depends on the student ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding kind regards

Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python
is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries i understand that in a professional setting we often work on multiple projects simultaneously and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects additionally when managing dependencies would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirementstxt file my understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirementstxt file it installs the latest available version whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation however i have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install requiring me to
however i have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install requiring me to modify the requirementstxt file and remove the version constraint in such cases wouldnt installing directly via pip be more practical that said i also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements id appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently
Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python
yes using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on python projects this approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment the main reasons why you should use virtual environments isolation each project has its own set of dependencies preventing conflicts with other projects reproducibility a virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies portability you can share a project with others or deploy it without worrying about systemwide package versions interfering installing with pip individually pip install packagename good for quick experimentation and testing not ideal for longterm project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over
for longterm project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time using requirementstxt best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install r requirementstxt avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developers setup specifying versions in requirementstxt if you dont specify a version pip install r requirementstxt will install the latest available versions which might introduce unexpected breaking changes if you do specify a version package you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues handling version conflicts if a package version fails to install try removing the strict
issues handling version conflicts if a package version fails to install try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall instead of completely omitting version numbers consider using greater thanless than constraints package allows updates but avoids major version changes running pip freeze requirementstxt after confirming a stable environment best practices summary always use a virtual environment eg venv or conda use a requirementstxt file for reproducibility pin versions cautiouslyavoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages kind regards
Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python
for some projects where there are many dependencies like an ml project or flask app its better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions whereas for some simple projects with less dependencies global installation is fine for project that is to be deployed make sure you use the virtual environment only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement f additionally when managing dependencies would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirementstxt file coming to your second question the first time you install a fresh dependency use direct and latest version but if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someones project its better to use requirementstxt f my
or thinking of sharing the repo or using someones project its better to use requirementstxt f my understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirementstxt file it installs the latest available version whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation the creation of requirementstxt ensures that the current installation version is listed never try to list requirementstxt there is a command to do that pip freeze requirementstxt this does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you

Need Clarity
i feel that week is packed with tutorials from diverse areas while i understand the necessity of these tutorials they lack immediate exercises which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses additionally while solving gas helps reinforce learning they dont seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials i would want to know whether the learning from gas is sufficient or if theres a better way to balance this ps to address this at a management level my suggestion would be to introduce aqs or mini exercises after each module alternatively we could increase questions in gas to cover more concepts though the first approach might be more effective another improvement could be to reduce
concepts though the first approach might be more effective another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable

my doubt is that will there be any coding level questions in the roe and the weekly graded assignments"

in roe usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course for example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some xyz disease in that pdf now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal same goes for assignments they will be more like minor project works"
