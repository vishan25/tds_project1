            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""date"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format""
                },
                ""time"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""Meeting time in HH:MM format""
                },
                ""meetingroom"": {
                    ""type"": ""string"",
                    ""description"": ""Name of the meeting room""

            ""required"": [""date"", ""time"", ""meetingroom""],
            ""additionalProperties"": False
        },
        ""strict"": True
    }
}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
How to define multiple functions
You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the tools parameter.
Here’s an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses:
tools = [
    {
        ""type"": ""function"",
        ""function"": {
            ""name"": ""getexpensebalance"",
            ""description"": ""Get expense balance for an employee"",
            ""parameters"": {
                ""type"": ""object"",
                ""properties"": {
                    ""employeeid"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Employee ID number""
                    }
                },
                ""required"": [""employeeid""],
                ""additionalProperties"": False
            },
            ""strict"": True
        }
    },
    {
        ""type"": ""function"",
        ""function"": {
            ""name"": ""calculateperformancebonus"",
            ""description"": ""Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee"",
            ""parameters"": {
                ""type"": ""object"",
                ""properties"": {
                    ""employeeid"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Employee ID number""
                    },
                    ""currentyear"": {
                        ""type"": ""integer"",
                        ""description"": ""Year to calculate bonus for""
                    }
                },
                ""required"": [""employeeid"", ""currentyear""],
                ""additionalProperties"": False
            },
            ""strict"": True
        }
    }
]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Best Practices:
1. Use Strict Mode
    Always set strict: True to ensure valid function calls
    Define all required parameters
    Set additionalProperties: False
2. Use tool choice
    Set toolchoice: ""required"" to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools
    The default is toolchoice: ""auto"" which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate
3. Clear Descriptions
    Write detailed function and parameter descriptions
    Include expected formats and units
    Mention any constraints or limitations
4. Error Handling
    Validate function inputs before execution
    Return clear error messages
    Handle missing or invalid parameters

----------------------------------------------------------
Vector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently.
Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON’T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.)
Vector databases are an evolving space.
The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:
 chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025
 qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025
 lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025
 faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025
 milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025
 weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025
In addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:
 DuckDB: Supports vector search with vss.
 SQLite: Supports vector search with sqlite-vec.
 PostgreSQL: Supports vector search with pgvector.

Convert_PDFs_to_Markdown.md,"Converting PDFs to Markdown
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).
Use Cases:
 LLM training and fine-tuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training
 Knowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents
 Content repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication
 Data extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis
 Accessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers
 Citation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers
 Documentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation
PyMuPDF4LLM
PyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.
PyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.
PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(""pymupdf4llm.md"", ""w""); h.write(pymupdf4llm.tomarkdown(""$FILE.pdf""))'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
 PYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale
 uv run --with pymupdf4llm: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package
 python -c '...': Executes Python code directly from the command line
 import pymupdf4llm: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module
 h = open(""pymupdf4llm.md"", ""w""): Creates a file to write the markdown output
 h.write(pymupdf4llm.tomarkdown(""$FILE.pdf"")): Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file
Markitdown
------------------------------------------------------
[](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg)
Markitdown is Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.

Unstructured
Unstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.
GROBID
----------------------------------------------
If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, GROBID remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.
Start GROBID service
docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2
Process PDF with curl
curl -X POST -F ""input=@paper.pdf"" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xmlCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Mistral OCR API
Mistral OCR offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.
Azure Document Intelligence API
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, Azure Document Intelligence provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities.
Other libraries
Docling is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.
MegaParse takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.
Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PyMuPDF4LLM | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch | AI training data, semantic structure |
| Markitdown | Multi-format support, simple usage | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents |
| Unstructured | Wide format support, active development | Can be resource-intensive | Production pipelines, integration |
| GROBID | Reference extraction excellence | Narrower use case | Academic papers, citations |
| Docling | Advanced document understanding | Installation difficulties | Research applications |
| MegaParse | Comprehensive approach | Requires OpenAI API | Complex documents, OCR needs |
How to pick:
 Need LLM-ready content? PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this
 Working with multiple document formats? Markitdown handles diverse inputs
 Extracting academic references? GROBID remains the standard
 Building a production pipeline? Unstructured offers the best integration options
 Handling complex layouts? Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence
The optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.
Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Pre-process PDFs when possible:
   
   Optimize a PDF for text extraction first
   ocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdfCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
2. Try multiple tools on the same document to compare results:
3. Handle scanned PDFs appropriately:
   
   For scanned documents, run OCR first
   ocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocrready.pdf
   PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocrready.pdf > markitdown.mdCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
4. Consider post-processing for better results:

JSON.md,"JSON
----------------------
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the de facto standard format for data exchange on the web and APIs. Its human-readable format and widespread support make it essential for data scientists working with web services, APIs, and configuration files.
For data scientists, JSON is essential when:
 Working with REST APIs and web services
 Storing configuration files and metadata
 Parsing semi-structured data from databases like MongoDB
 Creating data visualization specifications (e.g., Vega-Lite)
Watch this comprehensive introduction to JSON (15 min):
[](https://youtu.be/GpOO5iKzOmY)
Key concepts to understand in JSON:
 JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects
 You can nest data. Arrays and objects can contain other data types, including other arrays and objects
 Always validate. Ensure JSON is well-formed. Comm errors: Trailing commas, missing quotes, and escape characters
JSON Lines is a format that allows you to store multiple JSON objects in a single line.
It’s useful for logging and streaming data.
Tools you could use with JSON:
 JSONLint: Validate and format JSON
 JSON Editor Online: Visual JSON editor and formatter
 JSON Schema: Define the structure of your JSON data
 jq: Command-line JSON processor
Common Python operations with JSON:
import json
Parse JSON string
jsonstr = '{""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}'
data = json.loads(jsonstr)
Convert to JSON string
jsonstr = json.dumps(data, indent=2)
Read JSON from file
with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
Write JSON to file
with open('output.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
Read JSON data a Pandas DataFrame. JSON data is typically stored as an array of objects.
import pandas as pd
df = pd.readjson('data.json')
Read JSON lines from file into a DataFrame. JSON lines are typically one line per object.

Serverless_hosting__Vercel.md,"Serverless hosting: Vercel
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They’re perfect for small web tools that don’t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses:
 A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)
 A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)
 A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)
 A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)
 A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)
You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!
Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:
 You can’t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt
 You can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.
 You can’t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run())
Vercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.
Here’s a quickstart. Sign-up with Vercel. Create an empty git repo with this api/index.py file.

Whisper transcription
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Faster Whisper is a highly optimized implementation of OpenAI’s Whisper model, offering up to 4x faster transcription while using less memory.
You can install it via:
 pip install faster-whisper
 Download Windows Standalone
Here’s a basic usage example:
faster-whisper-xxl ""video.mp4"" --model medium --language enCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Here’s my recommendation for transcribing videos. This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory.
faster-whisper-xxl --printprogress --outputdir source --batchrecursive \
                   --checkfiles --standard --outputformat json srt \
                   --model medium --language en $FILECopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 --model: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from:
  + tiny: Fastest but least accurate
  + base: Good for simple audio
  + small: Balanced speed/accuracy
  + medium: Recommended default
  + large-v3: Most accurate but slowest
 --outputformat: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from:
  + json: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc.
  + srt: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example.
  + vtt: A modern subtitle format.
  + txt: Just the text transcript
 --outputdir: The directory to save the output files. source indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input $FILE is
 --language: The language of the input file. If you don’t specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it.
Run faster-whisper-xxl --help for more options.
Gemini transcription
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Gemini models from Google are notable in two ways:
1. They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.
2. They can handle audio input.
This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.
LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:
1. Transcribe into other languages. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.
2. Summarize audio transcripts. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.
3. Legal Proceeding Analysis. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.
4. Medical Consultation Summary. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.
Here’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.
1. Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
2. Set the GEMINIAPIKEY environment variable to the API key.
3. Set the MP3FILE environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe.
4. Run this code:
   
   curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \
     -H ""X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINIAPIKEY"" \

6. Data Analysis"
Unicode.md,"Unicode
-------------------------------
Ever noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.
Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.
Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.
Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.
Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:
 Character Encodings: Different ways to represent text in computers
  + ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only
  + UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII
  + UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java
  + UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple
Common encoding issues you’ll encounter:
Reading files with explicit encoding
with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    text = f.read()
Handling encoding errors
import pandas as pd
df = pd.readcsv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')
Detecting file encoding
import chardet
with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f:
    result = chardet.detect(f.read())
print(result['encoding'])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied

Hybrid_RAG_with_TypeSense.md,"Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation.
Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line.
Install and run TypeSense
Install TypeSense.
mkdir typesense-data
docker run -p 8108:8108 \
  -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \
  --data-dir /data \
  --api-key=secret-key \
  --enable-corsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 docker run: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108
  + -p 8108:8108 maps host port to container port.
  + -v typesense-data:/data mounts a Docker volume for persistence.
  + --data-dir /data points TypeSense at that volume.
  + --api-key=secret-key secures your API.
  + --enable-cors allows browser-based requests.
Expected output:
 Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as Started Typesense API server.
 Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8108.
Embed and import documents into TypeSense
Follow the steps in the RAG with the CLI tutorial to create a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line.
TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents. We’ll use that capability.
Save the following as addnotes.py and run it with uv run addnotes.py.
/// script
requires-python = "">=3.13""
dependencies = [""httpx""]
///
import json
import httpx
import os
headers = {""X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY"": ""secret-key""}
schema = {
    ""name"": ""notes"",
    ""fields"": [
        {""name"": ""id"", ""type"": ""string"", ""facet"": False},
        {""name"": ""content"", ""type"": ""string"", ""facet"": False},
        {
            ""name"": ""embedding"",
            ""type"": ""float[]"",
            ""embed"": {
                ""from"": [""content""],
                ""modelconfig"": {
                    ""modelname"": ""openai/text-embedding-3-small"",
                    ""apikey"": os.getenv(""OPENAIAPIKEY""),
                },
            },
        },
    ],
}
with open(""chunks.json"", ""r"") as f:
    chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]
with httpx.Client() as client:
    Create the collection
    if client.get(f""http://localhost:8108/collections/notes"", headers=headers).statuscode == 404:
        r = client.post(""http://localhost:8108/collections"", json=schema, headers=headers)
    Embed the chunks
    result = client.post(
        ""http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace"",
        headers={headers, ""Content-Type"": ""text/plain""},
        data=""\n"".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),
    )
    print(result.text)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
 httpx.Client: an HTTP client for Python.
 Collection schema: id and content fields plus an embedding field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI.
 Auto-embedding: the embed block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document.
 GET /collections/notes: checks existence.
 POST /collections: creates the collection.
 POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly.
Expected output:
 A JSON summary string like {""success"": X, ""failed"": 0} indicating how many docs were imported.
 (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.)
4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question
Now, we can use a single curl against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a hybrid search:
Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
payload=$(jq -n --arg coll ""notes"" --arg q ""$Q"" \
  '{
     searches: [
       {
         collection: $coll,
         q:           $q,
         queryby:    ""content,embedding"",
         sortby:     ""textmatch:desc"",
         prefix:      false,
         excludefields: ""embedding""
       }
     ]
   }'
)
curl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multisearch' \
  -H ""X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key"" \
  -d ""$payload"" \
  | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \
  | llm -s ""${Q} - \$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes."" \
  | uvx streamdownCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 queryby: ""content,embedding"": tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity.
 sortby: ""textmatch:desc"": boosts exact text hits.
 excludefields: ""embedding"": keeps responses lightweight.
 curl -d: posts the search request.
 jq -r: extracts each hit’s content. See jq manual
 llm -s and uvx streamdown: generate and stream a grounded answer.
Expected output:
 The raw matched snippets printed first.
 Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.

REST_APIs.md,"REST APIs
-------------------------------------
REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are the standard way to build web services that allow different systems to communicate over HTTP. They use standard HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange.
Watch this comprehensive introduction to REST APIs (52 min):
[](https://youtu.be/qbLc5a9jdXo)
Key Concepts:
1. HTTP Methods
    GET: Retrieve data
    POST: Create new data
    PUT/PATCH: Update existing data
    DELETE: Remove data
2. Status Codes
    2xx: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
    4xx: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
    5xx: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error)
Here’s a minimal REST API using FastAPI. Run this server.py script via uv run server.py:
/// script
requires-python = "">=3.13""
dependencies = [
""fastapi"",
""uvicorn"",
]
///
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing import Dict, List
app = FastAPI()
Create a list of items that will act like a database
items: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = []
Create a GET endpoint that returns all items
@app.get(""/items"")
async def getitems() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]:
    return items
Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID
@app.get(""/items/{itemid}"")
async def getitem(itemid: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:
    if item := next((i for i in items if i[""id""] == itemid), None):
        return item
    raise HTTPException(statuscode=404, detail=""Item not found"")
Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item
@app.post(""/items"")
async def createitem(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:
    newitem = {""id"": len(items) + 1, ""name"": item[""name""], ""price"": float(item[""price""])}
    items.append(newitem)
    return newitem
if name == ""main"":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host=""0.0.0.0"", port=8000)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Test the API with curl:
Get all items
curl http://localhost:8000/items
Create an item
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{""name"": ""Book"", ""price"": 29.99}'
Get specific item
curl http://localhost:8000/items/1Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Best Practices:
1. Use Nouns for Resources
    Good: /users, /posts
    Bad: /getUsers, /createPost
2. Version Your API
   
   /api/v1/users
   /api/v2/usersCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
3. Handle Errors Consistently

Scheduled_Scraping_with_GitHub_Actions.md,"Scheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Actions provides an excellent platform for running web scrapers on a schedule. This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows.
Key Concepts
 Scheduling: Use cron syntax to run scrapers at specific times
 Dependencies: Install required packages like httpx, lxml
 Data Storage: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository
 Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing
 Rate Limiting: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests
Here’s a sample scrape.py that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:

from datetime import datetime, UTC
from lxml import html
from typing import List, Dict
def scrapeimdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:

        year = (
            item.cssselect("".cli-title-metadata span"")[0].textcontent()
            if item.cssselect("".cli-title-metadata span"")
            else None
        )
        rating = (

        )
        if title and year and rating:
            movies.append({""title"": title, ""year"": year, ""rating"": rating})
    return movies
Scrape data and save with timestamp
now = datetime.now(UTC)

CSS_Selectors.md,"CSS Selectors
-------------------------------------------------
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They are fundamental to web development and data scraping, allowing you to precisely target elements for styling or extraction.
For data scientists, understanding CSS selectors is crucial when:
 Web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
 Selecting elements for browser automation with Selenium
 Styling data visualizations and web applications
 Debugging website issues using browser DevTools
Watch this comprehensive introduction to CSS selectors (20 min):
[](https://youtu.be/l1mER1bV0N0)
The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides detailed documentation on the three main types of selectors:
 Basic CSS selectors: Learn about element (div), class (.container), ID (header), and universal () selectors
 Attribute selectors: Target elements based on their attributes or attribute values ([type=""text""])
 Combinators: Use relationships between elements (div > p, div + p, div ~ p)

async def processimage(path: str) -> Image.Image:
    """"""Process an image with basic enhancements.""""""
    with Image.open(path) as img:
        Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility
        img = img.convert('RGB')
        Resize maintaining aspect ratio
        img.thumbnail((800, 800))
        Apply enhancements
        img = (ImageEnhance.Contrast(img)
               .enhance(1.2))
        return img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN)
if name == ""main"":
    import asyncio
    img = asyncio.run(processimage(""input.jpg""))
    img.save(""output.jpg"", quality=85)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied

async def transformimage(
    path: str,
    size: tuple[int, int],
    rotation: float = 0
) -> Image.Image:
    """"""Transform image with basic operations.""""""
    with Image.open(path) as img:
        Resize with anti-aliasing
        img = img.resize(size, Image.LANCZOS)
        Rotate around center
        if rotation:
            img = img.rotate(rotation, expand=True)
        Auto-crop empty edges
        img = img.crop(img.getbbox())
        return imgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Color and Enhancement
Adjust image appearance with built-in enhancement tools:
from PIL import ImageEnhance, ImageOps
async def enhanceimage(
    img: Image.Image,
    brightness: float = 1.0,
    contrast: float = 1.0,
    saturation: float = 1.0
) -> Image.Image:
    """"""Apply color enhancements to image.""""""
    enhancers = [
        (ImageEnhance.Brightness, brightness),
        (ImageEnhance.Contrast, contrast),
        (ImageEnhance.Color, saturation)
    ]
    for Enhancer, factor in enhancers:
        if factor != 1.0:
            img = Enhancer(img).enhance(factor)
    return imgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Filters and Effects
Apply visual effects and filters to images:
from PIL import ImageFilter
def applyeffects(img: Image.Image) -> Image.Image:
    """"""Apply various filters and effects.""""""
    effects = {
        'blur': ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=2),
        'sharpen': ImageFilter.SHARPEN,
        'edge': ImageFilter.FINDEDGES,
        'emboss': ImageFilter.EMBOSS
    }
    return {name: img.filter(effect)
            for name, effect in effects.items()}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Drawing and Text
Add text, shapes, and overlays to images:
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
async def addwatermark(
    img: Image.Image,
    text: str,
    fontsize: int = 30
) -> Image.Image:
    """"""Add text watermark to image.""""""
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    font = ImageFont.truetype(""arial.ttf"", fontsize)
    Calculate text size and position
    textbbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), text, font=font)
    textwidth = textbbox[2] - textbbox[0]
    textheight = textbbox[3] - textbbox[1]
    Position text at bottom-right
    x = img.width - textwidth - 10
    y = img.height - textheight - 10
    Add text with shadow
    draw.text((x+2, y+2), text, font=font, fill='black')
    draw.text((x, y), text, font=font, fill='white')
    return imgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Memory-Efficient Processing
Handle large images without loading them entirely into memory:
from PIL import Image

LLM_Agents.md,"LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.
[](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)
What Makes an Agent?
An LLM agent consists of three core components:
1. LLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next
2. Tools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)
3. Memory: Retains context across multiple steps
Agents operate through a loop:
 Observe the environment
 Think about what to do
 Take action using tools
 Observe results
 Repeat until task completion
Command-Line Agent Example
We’ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that:
1. Takes a task description from the command line
2. Generates code to accomplish the task
3. Automatically extracts and executes the code
4. Passes the results back to the LLM
5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails
Here’s how it works:
uv run llm-cmd-agent.py ""list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size""
uv run llm-cmd-agent.py ""convert the largest Markdown file to HTML""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
The agent will:
1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes
2. Execute the script in a subprocess
3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)
4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation
5. Present a final answer to the user
Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow:
1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script
2. Code extraction from the LLM response
3. Code execution in a subprocess
4. Result interpretation by the LLM
5. Error handling and retry logic if needed
This demonstrates the core agent loop of:
 Planning (generating code)
 Execution (running the code)
 Reflection (interpreting results)
 Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)
Agent Architectures
Different agent architectures exist for different use cases:
1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions
2. Reflexion: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning
3. MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules
4. Plan-and-Execute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps
Real-World Applications
LLM agents can be applied to various domains:
1. Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information
2. Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code
3. Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data
4. Customer service agents that handle queries and perform actions
5. Personal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks
Project Ideas
Here are some practical agent projects you could build:
1. Study buddy agent: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts
2. Job application assistant: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses
3. Personal finance agent: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities
4. Health and fitness coach: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation
5. Course project helper: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work
Best Practices
1. Clear instructions: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations
2. Effective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable
3. Robust error handling: Agents should recover gracefully from failures
4. Memory management: Balance context retention with token efficiency
5. User feedback: Allow users to correct or guide the agent
Limitations and Challenges
Current LLM agents face several challenges:
1. Hallucination: Agents may generate false information or tool calls
2. Planning limitations: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities
3. Tool integration complexity: Each new tool adds implementation overhead
4. Context window constraints: Limited memory for long-running tasks
5. Security concerns: Tool access requires careful permission management

Parsing JSON"
Parsing_JSON.md,"Parsing JSON
----------------------------------------------
JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.
For example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.
[](https://youtu.be/1lxrbezP-g)
This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:
| Tool | Extract from JSON… | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jq | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |
| JMESPath | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax |
| ijson | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently |
| Pandas | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data |
| SQL JSON | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data |
| DuckDB | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |
Examples:
 Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.
 Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.
 Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.
Practice with these resources:
 JSONPath Online Evaluator: Test JSON queries
 jq play: Interactive jq query testing
 DuckDB JSON Tutorial: Learn DuckDB JSON functions
Command-line JSON Processing with jq
jq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.
Example: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.
Extract specific fields from JSONL
cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == ""user"") | {id, name}'
Transform JSON structure
cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'
Filter and aggregate
cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'groupby(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
JMESPath Queries
JMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.
Example: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.
import jmespath
Example queries
data = {
    ""locations"": [
        {""name"": ""Seattle"", ""state"": ""WA"", ""info"": {""population"": 737015}},
        {""name"": ""Portland"", ""state"": ""OR"", ""info"": {""population"": 652503}}
    ]
}
Find all cities with population > 700000
cities = jmespath.search(""locations[?info.population > 700000].name"", data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Streaming with ijson
Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.
Example: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.
import ijson
async def processlargejson(filepath: str) -> list:
    """"""Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.""""""
    results = []
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
        Stream objects under the 'items' key
        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')
        async for item in parser:
            if item['value'] > 100:  Process conditionally
                results.append(item)
    return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Pandas JSON Columns
Pandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.
Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.
import pandas as pd
Parse JSON strings in a column
df = pd.DataFrame({'jsoncol': ['{""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 30}', '{""name"": ""Bob"", ""age"": 25}']})
df['parsed'] = df['jsoncol'].apply(pd.jsonnormalize)
Normalize nested JSON columns
df = pd.readcsv('data.csv')
dfnormalized = pd.jsonnormalize(
    df['nestedjson'].apply(json.loads),
    recordpath=['items'],        List of nested objects to unpack
    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      Keep these columns from parent
)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
SQL JSON Functions
SQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.
These are implemented by most popular databases, including
SQLite,
PostgreSQL, and
MySQL.
This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.
Example: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.
SELECT
    jsonextract(data, '$.name') as name,
    jsonextract(data, '$.details.age') as age
FROM users
WHERE jsonextract(data, '$.active') = trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
DuckDB JSON Processing
DuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.
Example: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.
SELECT
    jsonextractstring(data, '$.user.name') as name,
    avg(jsonextractfloat(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avgvalue
FROM readjsonauto('data/.jsonl')

CORS.md,"CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.
Watch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):
[](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0)
Key CORS concepts:
 Same-Origin Policy: Browsers block requests between different origins by default
 CORS Headers: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests
 Preflight Requests: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed
 Credentials: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication
If you’re exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: .
Here are other common CORS headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
To implement CORS in FastAPI, use the CORSMiddleware middleware:
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
app = FastAPI()
app.addmiddleware(CORSMiddleware, alloworigins=[""""]) Allow GET requests from all origins
Or, provide more granular control:
app.addmiddleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    alloworigins=[""https://example.com""],  Allow a specific domain
    allowcredentials=True,  Allow cookies

Multimodal_Embeddings.md,"Multimodal Embeddings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multimodal embeddings map text and images into the same vector space, enabling direct comparison between, say, a caption — “A cute cat” — and an image of that cat. This unified representation powers real-world applications like:
 Cross-modal search (e.g. “find images of a sunset” via text queries)
 Content recommendation (suggesting visually similar products to text descriptions)
 Clustering & retrieval (grouping documents and their associated graphics)
 Anomaly detection (spotting unusual image–text pairings)
By reducing different data types to a common numeric form, you unlock richer search, enhanced recommendations, and tighter integration of visual and textual data.

=============================================================================
Create a virtual Teaching Assistant Discourse responder.
Background
----------------------------------------------------
You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras’ Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the Tools in Data Science course.
Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:
 Course content with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025.
 TDS Discourse posts with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.
Scrape the data
--------------------------------------------------------------
To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.
Create an API
----------------------------------------------------------
Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let’s assume it’s at https://app.example.com/api/.
The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.
For example, here’s how anyone can make a request:
curl ""https://app.example.com/api/"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d ""{\""question\"": \""Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\"", \""image\"": \""$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\""}""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
This is a real question and uses this screenshot:
The response must be a JSON object like this:
{
  ""answer"": ""You must use gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, even if the AI Proxy only supports gpt-4o-mini. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question."",
  ""links"": [
    {
      ""url"": ""https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4"",
      ""text"": ""Use the model that’s mentioned in the question.""
    },
    {
      ""url"": ""https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3"",
      ""text"": ""My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.""
    }
  ]
}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Evaluate your application
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are a few sample questions and evaluation parameters. These are indicative. The actual evaluation could ask any realistic student question.
To run this:
1. Edit project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml to replace providers[0].config.url with your API URL.
2. Run this script:
   
   npx -y promptfoo eval --config project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yamlCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
Deploy your application
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform.
(If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)
Share your code
--------------------------------------------------------------
 Create a new public GitHub repository
 Add an MIT LICENSE file
 Commit and push your code
Submit your URL
--------------------------------------------------------------
Submit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL at <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-project-virtual-ta>
Evaluation
----------------------------------------------------
 Pre-requisites: Your repository MUST meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation
  + Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible
  + Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license in the root folder
 We will use a modified version of project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml with 10 realistic questions. Correct answers will be awarded up to 2 marks each.
 Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get.
Bonus:
 1 mark if your GitHub repo includes a script that scrapes the Discourse posts across a date range from a Discourse course page like TDS
 2 marks if we deploy your solution (with minimal modifications) as an official solution for students to use.

4. Data Sourcing"
TDS_GPT_Reviewer.md,"TDS GPT Reviewer
==========================================================
After the later parts of this course’s contents were written, we ran it through a Technical Content Reviewer GPT.
Take a look at the GPT’s instructions. These were generated by the OpenAI Prompt Generation tool.
As a Content Reviewer for a high school–level course on Tools in Data Science, your job is to evaluate provided content (such as text, code snippets, or references) with a focus on correctness, clarity, and conciseness, and offer actionable feedback for improvement.
1. Check for Correctness and Consistency
   - Verify technical and factual accuracy.
   - Ensure internal consistency without contradictions.
2. Check for Clarity and Approachability
   - Ensure content is understandable for a high school student with limited prior knowledge.
   - Identify and simplify jargon or advanced concepts.
3. Check for Conciseness
   - Assess if content is direct and free of unnecessary verbosity.
   - Identify areas for streamlining to enhance readability.
4. Provide Feedback for Improvement
   - Offer actionable suggestions for fixing, clarifying, or reorganizing content.
   - Propose alternative phrasing if text is vague, complex, or verbose.
Steps
1. Carefully read the entire content before forming conclusions.
2. List factual inconsistencies or missing details causing confusion.
3. Suggest simpler terms or analogies for complex language.
4. Point out unnecessary repetition or filler text.
5. Provide direct examples of how to improve the highlighted issues.
Output Format
Respond using Markdown with the following structure:
1. Summary of Findings
   - A concise paragraph outlining overall strengths and weaknesses.
2. Detailed Review
   - Correctness and Consistency: Note factual errors or inconsistencies, suggesting corrections.
   - Clarity and Approachability: Identify overly advanced or unclear sections, offering simpler alternatives.
   - Conciseness: Highlight long or repetitive sections with suggestions for tightening the text.
3. Actionable Improvement Suggestions
   - Provide specific sentences, bullet points, or rewritten examples to illustrate improvements.
Notes
- Maintain a constructive review tone, not content generation.
- Even if content is perfect, confirm with suggestions for minor improvements (e.g., adding an example or clarifying a subtle point).Copy to clipboardErrorCopied

RAG_with_the_CLI).md,"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning.
In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:
Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
Answer: fat arrow
Q=""What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?""
Answer: node.getChildren()
Q=""What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?""
Answer: trivia
Q=""Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?""
Answer: !!Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.
1. Clone the repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book
cd typescript-bookCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 --depth 1 fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.
 cd typescript-book moves into the project folder.
You’ll now be in a new folder typescript-book containing the repo.
2. Split Markdown files into chunks
(
  shopt -s globstar
  for f in /.md; do
    uvx --from splitmarkdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt ""$f"" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator ""===SPLIT==="" \
    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\n/' \
    | jq -R -s -c --arg file ""$f"" '
      split(""===SPLIT==="")[1:]
      | toentries
      | map({
          id: ($file + """" + (.key | tostring)),
          content: .value
        })[]
    '
  done
) | tee chunks.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 shopt -s globstar: lets /.md match Markdown files in all subdirectories. bash shopt manual
 uvx --from splitmarkdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt: a tool that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks:
  + --model gpt-4o: uses GPT‑4o token limits
  + --limit 4096: max tokens per chunk
  + --separator ""===SPLIT==="": custom split marker
 sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\n/': ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual)
 jq -R -s -c --arg file ""$f"": uses jq to convert chunks to JSON
  + -R: read raw input
  + -s: slurp entire input into a single string
  + -c: compact JSON output
  + builds an array of objects {id, content}, where id is filenamechunkIndex
 tee chunks.json: writes the resulting JSON array to chunks.json while printing it to stdout.
You’ll now have a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line.
3. Generate embeddings
llm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 embed-multi: computes embeddings for each entry in chunks.json.
 typescript-book: a namespace or collection name for storage.
 --model 3-small: selects the embedding model.
 --store: save embeddings in the default backend.
 --format nl: input is newline‑delimited JSON. llm CLI embed-multi
This stores the embeddings in a collection called typescript-book.
llm collections path  shows where the collections are stored
llm collections delete typescript-book  deletes the typescript-book collectionCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
4. Find similar topics
llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c ""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
This returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.
 similar: retrieves the top n most similar chunks from the embeddings store.
 -n 3: return three results.
 -c: the user’s query string.
5. Answer a question using retrieved context
Q=""What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?""
llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c ""$Q"" \
  | jq '.content' \
  | llm -s ""$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes."" \
  | uvx streamdownCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
This answers the question in natural language following these steps:
1. Store the query in Q.
2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks.
3. jq '.content' extracts just the text snippets.
4. Pipe into llm -s, instructing the model:
    -s: stream a prompt directly to the LLM.
    ""$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes."": ensures the response is grounded.
5. uvx streamdown formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading.

Crawling_with_the_CLI.md,"Crawling with the CLI
----------------------------------------------------------------
Since websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline.
Web crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios:
 Data mining and analysis: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research
 Content archiving: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes
 SEO analysis: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings
 Legal compliance: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation
 Website migration: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design
 Offline access: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection
The most commonly used tool for fetching websites is wget. It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.
[](https://youtu.be/pLfH5TZBGXo)
To crawl the IIT Madras Data Science Program website for example, you could run:
wget \
  --recursive \
  --level=3 \
  --no-parent \
  --convert-links \
  --adjust-extension \
  --compression=auto \
  --accept html,htm \
  --directory-prefix=./ds \
  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Here’s what each option does:
 --recursive: Enables recursive downloading (following links)
 --level=3: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL
 --no-parent: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory
 --convert-links: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally
 --adjust-extension: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types
 --compression=auto: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate)
 --accept html,htm: Only downloads files with these extensions
 --directory-prefix=./ds: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory
wget2 is a better version of wget and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same.
wget2 \
  --recursive \
  --level=3 \
  --no-parent \
  --convert-links \
  --adjust-extension \

Robots.txt
robots.txt is a standard file found in a website’s root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It’s part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.
Why it’s important:
 Server load protection: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers
 Privacy protection: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed
 Legal compliance: Respects website owners’ rights to control access to their content
 Ethical web citizenship: Shows respect for website administrators’ wishes
How to override robots.txt restrictions:
 wget, wget2: Use -e robots=off
 httrack: Use -s0
 wpull: Use --no-robots
When to override robots.txt (use with discretion):
Only bypass robots.txt when:
 You have explicit permission from the website owner
 You’re crawling your own website
 The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won’t cause server issues
 You’re conducting authorized security testing
Remember that bypassing robots.txt without legitimate reason may:
 Violate terms of service
 Lead to IP banning
 Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions
 Cause reputation damage to your organization
Always use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.

Google Auth is the most commonly implemented single sign-on mechanism because:
 It’s popular and user-friendly. Users can log in with their existing Google accounts.
 It’s secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication.
Here’s how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user.
1. Go to the Google Cloud Console – Credentials and click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID.
2. Choose Web application, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:8000/).
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into a .env file:
   
   GOOGLECLIENTID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLECLIENTSECRET=your-client-secretCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
4. Create your FastAPI app.py:
/// script
dependencies = [""python-dotenv"", ""fastapi"", ""uvicorn"", ""itsdangerous"", ""httpx"", ""authlib""]
///
import os
from dotenv import loaddotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

oauth.register(
    name=""google"",
    clientid=os.getenv(""GOOGLECLIENTID""),
    clientsecret=os.getenv(""GOOGLECLIENTSECRET""),
    servermetadataurl=""https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"",
    clientkwargs={""scope"": ""openid email profile""},
)
@app.get(""/"")
async def application(request: Request):
    user = request.session.get(""user"")
    3. For authenticated users: say hello
    if user:
        return f""Hello {user['email']}""
    2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session
    if ""code"" in request.queryparams:
        token = await oauth.google.authorizeaccesstoken(request)
        request.session[""user""] = token[""userinfo""]
        return RedirectResponse(""/"")
    1. For users who are logging in for the first time, redirect to Google login
    return await oauth.google.authorizeredirect(request, request.url)
if name == ""main"":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, port=8000)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Now, run uv run app.py.
1. When you visit <http://localhost:8000/> you’ll be redirected to a Google login page.
2. When you log in, you’ll be redirected back to <http://localhost:8000/>
3. Now you’ll see the email ID you logged in with.
Instead of displaying the email, you can show different content based on the user. For example:
 Allow access to specfic users and not others

Images__Compression.md,"Images: Compression
----------------------------------------------------------------
Image compression is essential when deploying apps. Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.
Here are things you should know when you’re compressing images:
 Image dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot
 Lossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data
 Lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files
 Vector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss
 WebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless
Here’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.
 Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one)
 Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP
Common operations with Python:
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import io
async def compressimage(inputpath: Path, outputpath: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:
    """"""Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.""""""
    with Image.open(inputpath) as img:
        Convert RGBA to RGB if needed
        if img.mode == 'RGBA':
            img = img.convert('RGB')
        Optimize for web
        img.save(outputpath, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)
Batch process images
paths = Path('images').glob('.jpg')
for p in paths:
    await compressimage(p, p.withsuffix('.webp'))Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Command line tools include cwebp, pngquant, jpegoptim, and ImageMagick.

Base_64_Encoding.md,"Base 64 Encoding
=========================================================
Base64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.
Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):
[](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)
Here’s how it works:
 It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters
 … using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4)
 There’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \ to avoid issues in URLs
 Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)
Common Python operations with Base64:
import base64
Basic encoding/decoding
text = ""Hello, World!""
Convert text to base64
encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
Convert base64 back to text
decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        Hello, World!
Convert to URL-safe base64
urlsafe = base64.urlsafeb64encode(text.encode()).decode()  SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==
Working with binary files (e.g., images)
with open('image.png', 'rb') as f:
    binarydata = f.read()
    imageb64 = base64.b64encode(binarydata).decode()
Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)
datauri = f""data:image/png;base64,{imageb64}""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.
For example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI:
<img
  src=""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+""
/>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Base64 is used in many places:
 JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads
 Email: MIME attachments encoding
 Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers
 JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication
 SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format
 SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO
 Git: Encoding binary files in patches

4._Data_Sourcing.md,"Data Sourcing
=================================================
Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it.
And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data.
There are three ways you can get the data.
1. The first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data.
2. The second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.
3. The third way is you have to scrape it. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.
In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

Convert_HTML_to_Markdown.md,"Converting HTML to Markdown
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:
 Content analysis: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing
 Data mining: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content
 Offline reading: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption
 Content migration: Move content between different CMS platforms
 SEO analysis: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization
 Archive creation: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats
 Accessibility: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers
This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line.
defuddle-cli
defuddle-cli specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.
find . -name '.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
 find . -name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
 -exec ... \;: Executes the following command for each file found
 npx --package defuddle-cli -y: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting
 defuddle parse {} --md: Parses the HTML file (represented by {}) and converts to markdown
 -o {}.md: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension
Pandoc
Pandoc is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.
Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.
[](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)
find . -name '.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdownstrict -o {}.md {} \;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
 find . -name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
 -exec ... \;: Executes the following command for each file found
 pandoc: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion
 -f html -t markdownstrict: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown
 -o {}.md {}: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument
Lynx
Lynx is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.
find . -type f -name '.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist ""$f"" > ""${f%.html}.txt""; done'  {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
 find . -type f -name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
 -exec sh -c '...'  {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency
 for f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch
 lynx -dump -nolist ""$f"": Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text
  + -dump: Output the rendered page to stdout
  + -nolist: Don’t include the list of links at the end
 > ""${f%.html}.txt"": Save output to a .txt file with the same base name
w3m
w3m is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.
find . -type f -name '.html' \
  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \
      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph ""$f"" > ""${f%.html}.md""; \
    done'  {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
 find . -type f -name '.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories
 -exec sh -c '...'  {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency
 for f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch
 w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph ""$f"": Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML
  + -dump: Output the rendered page to stdout
  + -T text/html: Specify input format as HTML
  + -cols 80: Set output width to 80 columns
  + -no-graph: Don’t show graphic characters for tables and frames
 > ""${f%.html}.md"": Save output to a .md file with the same base name
Comparison
| Approach | Speed | Format Quality | Preservation | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| defuddle-cli | Slow | High | Good structure and links | Content migration, publishing |
| pandoc | Slow | Very High | Almost everything | Academic papers, documentation |
| lynx | Fast | Low | Basic structure only | Quick extraction, large batches |
| w3m | Very Slow | Medium-Low | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx |
Optimize Batch Processing
1. Process in parallel: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:
   
   find . -name "".html"" | parallel ""pandoc -f html -t markdownstrict -o {}.md {}""Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
2. Filter files before processing:
   
   find . -name "".html"" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
3. Customize output format with additional parameters:
   
   For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting
   find . -name "".html"" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
4. Handle errors gracefully:
   
   find . -name "".html"" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown ""$f"" -o ""${f%.html}.md"" 2>/dev/null || echo ""Failed: $f"" >> conversionerrors.log; done'  {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
   
Choosing the Right Tool
 Need speed with minimal formatting? Use the lynx approach
 Need precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc
 Need a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddle-cli
 Working with complex tables? w3m might render them better
Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.
Combined Crawling and Conversion
Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler.
1. For research/data collection: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion
2. For simple website archiving: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution
3. For high-quality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion
4. For maximum speed: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline
Crawl4AI
Crawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
uv pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setupCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
 uv venv: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv)
 source .venv/bin/activate.fish: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax)
 uv pip install crawl4ai: Installs the crawl4ai package
 crawl4ai-setup: Initializes crawl4ai’s required dependencies
markdown-crawler
markdown-crawler combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It’s efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting.

Embeddings.md,"Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.
This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:
1. Search. Find similar documents to a query.
2. Classification. Classify text into categories.
3. Clustering. Group similar items into clusters.
4. Anomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text.
You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.
| Feature | Local Models | API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Privacy | High | Dependent on provider |
| Cost | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go |
| Scale | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |
| Quality | Varies by model | Typically high |
The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:
1. Rank. Higher ranked models have higher quality.
2. Memory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.
3. Embedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.
4. Max Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input.
5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.
Local Embeddings
[](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)
Here’s a minimal example using a local embedding model:
/// script
requires-python = ""==3.12""
dependencies = [
""sentence-transformers"",
""httpx"",
""numpy"",
]
///
from sentencetransformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np
model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  A small, high quality model
async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:
    """"""Get embedding vector for text using local model.""""""
    return model.encode(text).tolist()
async def getsimilarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
    """"""Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.""""""
    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))
    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))
    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1)  np.linalg.norm(emb2)))
async def main():
    print(await getsimilarity(""Apple"", ""Orange""))
    print(await getsimilarity(""Apple"", ""Lightning""))
if name == ""main"":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Note the getsimilarity function. It uses a Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.
OpenAI Embeddings
For comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the embed function in the earlier script:
import os
import httpx
async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:
    """"""Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.""""""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            ""https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings"",
            headers={""Authorization"": f""Bearer {os.environ['OPENAIAPIKEY']}""},
            json={""model"": ""text-embedding-3-small"", ""input"": text}
        )
        return response.json()[""data""][0][""embedding""]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
NOTE: You need to set the OPENAIAPIKEY environment variable for this to work.

3._Large_Language_Models.md,"Large Language Models
=========================================================================
This module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs).
LLMs incur a cost. For the May 2025 batch, use aipipe.org as a proxy.
Emails with @ds.study.iitm.ac.in get a $1 per calendar month allowance. (Don’t exceed that.)
Read the AI Pipe documentation to learn how to use it. But in short:
1. Replace OPENAIBASEURL, i.e. https://api.openai.com/v1 with https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1... or https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...
2. Replace OPENAIAPIKEY with the AIPIPETOKEN
3. Replace model names, e.g. gpt-4.1-nano, with openai/gpt-4.1-nano
For example, let’s use Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite via OpenRouter for chat completions and Text Embedding 3 Small via OpenAI for embeddings:
curl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPETOKEN"" \
  -d '{
    ""model"": ""google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001"",
    ""messages"": [{ ""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What is 2 + 2?""} }]
  }'
curl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPETOKEN"" \
  -d '{ ""model"": ""text-embedding-3-small"", ""input"": ""What is 2 + 2?"" }'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Or using llm:
llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPETOKEN
export OPENAIBASEURL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1
llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001
export OPENAIBASEURL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1
llm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-smallCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
For a 50% discount (but slower speed), use Flex processing by adding servicetier: ""flex"" to your JSON request.
AI Proxy - Jan 2025
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an iitm.ac.in email to use gpt-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-small. Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don’t exceed that.
Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAI. Specifically:
1. Replace your API to https://api.openai.com/... with https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...
2. Replace the OPENAIAPIKEY with the AIPROXYTOKEN that someone will give you.

Database__SQLite.md,"Database: SQLite
-----------------------------------------------
Relational databases are used to store data in a structured way. You’ll often access databases created by others for analysis.
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is SQLite. It’s embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It’s lightweight but very scalable and powerful.
Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it’s used in Python (34 min):
[](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8)
[](https://youtu.be/Ohj-CqALrwk)
There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Redis, etc. that you should know about and we may cover later.
Core Concepts:
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    createdat DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENTTIMESTAMP
);
-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES
    ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
    ('Bob', 'bob@example.com');
-- Query data
SELECT name, COUNT() as count
FROM users
GROUP BY name
HAVING count > 1;
-- Join tables
SELECT u.name, o.product
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.userid
WHERE o.status = 'pending';Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
Python Integration:
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
async def querydatabase(dbpath: Path, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """"""Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame.

        dbpath: Path to SQLite database
        query: SQL query to execute
    Returns:

    """"""
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(dbpath)
        return pd.readsqlquery(query, conn)
    finally:
        conn.close()
Example usage
db = Path('data.db')
df = await querydatabase(db, '''

LLM_Image_Generation.md,"Gemini Flash Experimental Image Generation and Editing APIs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In March 2025, Google introduced native image generation and editing capabilities in the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model. You can now generate and iteratively edit images via a single REST endpoint (Experiment with Gemini 2.0 Flash native image generation, Generate images | Gemini API | Google AI for Developers).
[](https://youtu.be/wgs4UYx6quY) (How to use Latest Gemini 2.0 Native Image Generation with API?)
Simple image generation
To generate a basic image, send a POST request to the generateContent method:
curl ""https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation:generateContent?key=$GEMINIAPIKEY"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -X POST \

  }' | jq -r '.candidates[].content.parts[] | select(.inlineData) | .inlineData.data' | base64 --decode > image.pngCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
Replace $GEMINIAPIKEY with your key. (Gemini API | Google AI for Developers)
Generation options
You can tweak the output with these generationConfig parameters:
 responseModalities: Modalities to return (TEXT, IMAGE).
 temperature (0.0–2.0): Controls randomness (default 1.0).
 topP (0.0–1.0): Nucleus sampling threshold.
 topK: Token selection cutoff.
 maxOutputTokens: Max tokens for text parts.
 stopSequences: Sequences to end generation.
 seed: For reproducibility.

Costs and optimization
Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental uses token-based billing:
 Input (text/image/video): free tier, then $0.10 per 1M tokens.
 Output (text/image): free tier, then $0.40 per 1M tokens.
 Per-image flat cost for Pro models: ~$0.001315 /image (Gemini Developer API Pricing | Gemini API | Google AI for Developers, Solved: Re: Outdated Gemini Pro image pricing? By tile, or…).
To optimize:
 Use smaller image sizes by setting responseMimeType.
 Cache or reuse prompts with cachedContent.
 Lower candidateCount or temperature for fewer tokens.
